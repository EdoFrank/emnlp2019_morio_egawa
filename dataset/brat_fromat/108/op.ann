T1	Major_Claim 21 89	Indoor live music gigs are far too loud, and should be quieter. CMV.
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 91 252	Why do sound technicians ruin so many indoor gigs by turning the whole volume up (especially the bass) so loud that the entire thing becomes distorted and mushy?
T3	Value 253 297	I love loud music as much as the next person
T4	Value 303 346	the volume level of music at gigs is absurd
T5	Testimony 348 436	I saw Less Than Jake at a very small venue (with a capacity of about 500 people at most)
T6	Value 441 530	the sound levels were absurdly high - the whole thing became a disorienting blur of sound
T7	Testimony 541 589	I brought ear plugs when I went to see The Bronx
T8	Value 595 706	the experience was incredible - I could actually hear the songs in a clarity that was comfortable and enjoyable
T9	Value 709 810	It seems to me that seasoned gig goers and sound-techs alike simply don't mind how loud live music is
T10	Value 819 944	their ear-drums have been significantly dulled from years of going to loud gigs (effectively removing the need for ear plugs)
T11	Value 946 1020	For those of us with hearing mostly intact, I think gigs are absurdly loud
T12	Value 1026 1246	sound-techs could reduce the volume by up to 50% in many cases for a much more pleasurable listening experience - still loud, but not so loud that the vocals and rhythm all fuse into what can be, effectively, white noise
T13	Value 1248 1287	In any case the bass needs to come down
T14	Value 1289 1369	When the bass is so loud that you feel your clothes rippling: something is wrong
T15	Value 1380 1420	I blame the sound-techs and not the band
T16	Value 1458 1552	it's very hard to tell what you sound like from the audience when on-stage, even with monitors
T17	Policy 1572 1594	gigs should be quieter
T18	Value 1596 1713	This would not only be more enjoyable, but spare many people the hearing loss later in life that live music can cause
T19	Policy 1715 1824	I don't think it should be acceptable to have a gig so loud that you hear a ringing in your ears the next day
T20	Value 1866 1888	I go to gigs in London
T21	Value 1896 1943	this isn't such an issue elsewhere in the world
T22	Value 1955 2026	As you may have noticed in the title, I'm only referring to indoor gigs
T23	Value 2028 2085	Outdoor gigs still tend to have sound issues of their own
T24	Value 2091 2246	their volume is generally at a much more comfortable level due to the sound having room to disperse rather than bouncing off walls in an indoor environment
T25	Value 2260 2318	I'm referring specifically to 'guitar oriented' live music
T26	Value 2320 2453	The issues in quality of sound are rarely - in my experience - present during a classical orchestra concert, or a jazz/swing band gig

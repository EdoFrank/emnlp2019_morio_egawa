T1	Value 91 124	I actually agree with you largely
T2	Value 135 179	a lot of the problem lies on the band itself
T3	Value 181 227	As a guitarist, I never would have believed it
T4	Value 233 280	I absolutely did once I shifted into live sound
T5	Value 286 308	Drums are fucking loud
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 310 348	Ever hear a drummer tear into a snare?
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 349 381	Ever hear one smash his cymbals?
T8	Value 382 525	In some small club shows, there's almost no need for a mic (except for the thump of a kick, and a little added sound just so nothing gets lost)
T9	Value 539 664	especially with rock bands, the guitarists feel the need to have guitar amps WAY overpowered for the space they're playing in
T10	Value 666 730	Nobody actually *needs* a 100 watt, 8x12 guitar amp and cabinets
T11	Value 732 805	30 watts and a 10" speaker are more than enough once you have a mic on it
T12	Value 811 1011	so many bands crank up their amps to the point where what you're hearing in the audience doesn't have anything to do with the sound guy and everything to do with "but I NEED to have my amp turned up!"
T13	Value 1016 1166	Way too much bass is a bad thing, yes, but at the same time please remember, your hearing probably isn't going to be damaged from bass that's too loud
T14	Value 1168 1305	It takes a hell of a lot more low-frequency power to do any remote sort of damage to your hearing than you will ever notice in a lifetime
T15	Value 1311 1408	PRO sound guys (not just the tech at your local night club) aren't dulled from years of loud gigs
T16	Value 1410 1527	We actually carry custom-moulded earplugs designed to reduce SPL without changing the sounds we're hearing (too much)
T17	Value 1529 1617	What you have to understand there is that MOST concert-goers only see an occasional show
T18	Value 1619 1696	The loud volumes won't do much damage if it only happens once or twice a year
T19	Value 1698 1809	Touring engineers are exposed to it every single day, often over 100 nights a year, plus soundcheck, rehearsals
T20	Value 1813 1876	I'd absolutely recommend earplugs for any frequent concert goer
T21	Value 1882 1986	it's not going to affect 75%+ (depending on genre) of the audience to see one show that's a bit too loud
T22	Value 2006 2039	this last factor is not in play..
T23	Value 2061 2123	it's a crapshoot as to what a venue has when it comes to sound
T24	Value 2125 2270	I tour with a national act, and I call venues before every single show, often two or three times, to make sure what they have will be good enough
T25	Value 2272 2347	Half the time, what I walk into is nothing like what they said on the phone
T26	Value 2349 2482	Or they have the whole rig set up wrong so it's not actually working at its full potential, or it's far too powerful for its own good
T27	Value 2484 2668	The problem gets even worse if the band doesn't have their own engineer; then it's entirely up to a house tech who is usually inexperienced or has already blown their ears out, or both
T28	Value 2670 2800	A band that carries its own sound system is going to be much better, but they're also going to only play larger venues like arenas
T29	Value 2806 2878	they'll have time to fine-tune the system to work perfectly for the room

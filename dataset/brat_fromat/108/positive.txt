op_title: Indoor live music gigs are far too loud, and should be quieter. CMV.

I may not want to change your view about the volume problem, but I do want to change your opinion regarding who is at fault.  Full disclosure, I have been working professionally as a sound engineer for 15 years. I'm not saying that the sound engineer is not also a part of the problem. The fault lies with many parties.  As a sound engineer, I fight band stage volume on every band I work with. Many times I have a producer (who writes my paycheck) telling me to turn it up. The guitarist whose amp is turned up to eleven.   The band manager who wants the whole thing turned up.  The drummer. (Enough said.) 

And yes, many sound techs just turn it up because the sound system can get that loud, not realizing that there is a difference between can and should.  I do the best I can to never mix bands anymore because it's not fun, it's just loud.  Plus, I think it may be worse in the US here as there are no local regulations that I know of for volume limits as there can be in the UK. I hope you can see though that there are many factors involved in creating that sound, and that when a show is too loud, a lot of people can be to blame.

op_title: I find the constant updating on Nelson Mandela's condition to be ghoulish and distasteful CMV

&gt;It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion.

No, its an event upon which the hopes of an entire nation hing. Mandela is his country's Martin Luther King Jr. Imagine that instead of the 60, the US had been segregated until 1994. Blacks, Whites, Asians, and 'Natives' were segregated in schools,beaches, and even where they lived. The mostly white government would even dictate where you would live in a city based on your race. 

Then imagine that one day it all changed. Imagine that one of the great black leaders who had fought against segregation for 30 years was president! Mix the election of Obama with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in ONE DAY. The 1994 election meant that Apartheid was ended, and there was a black president. You think African Americans were excited over Obama? This is nothing compared to the election of Mandela.

So the fact that he is dying is a pretty big deal. For South Africa, they don't want a morbid update on the deterioration of a political leader. They are holding vigil for a man who represents the greatest moment in their history.

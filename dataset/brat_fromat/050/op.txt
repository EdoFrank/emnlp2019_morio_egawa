op_title: I find the constant updating on Nelson Mandela's condition to be ghoulish and distasteful CMV

It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion.  He's in hospital, oh no it's intensive care, it's gone critical, people are praying, his condition worsens... and so on.  What next?  headlines about how he draws his last breath?  What his expression was?  It's sordid imo.  Why can't people wait for him to die and then report that.  Why report the minute by minute progress of the dying process.  

My front page is full of Mandela updates.  CMV I want to believe that there is something else going on and people aren't that... grisley

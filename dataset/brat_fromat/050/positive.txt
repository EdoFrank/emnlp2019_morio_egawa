op_title: I find the constant updating on Nelson Mandela's condition to be ghoulish and distasteful CMV

I find it a bit distasteful myself, but I somewhat take issue with: "It's like people are waiting with excitement for somebody to die as if it were a sporting occasion."

First, I think news organizations are reporting this situation obsessively for probably two reasons. One is that they are a business, they need to pursue stories that will have a large readership. The news wasn't always conducted in this manner, but today that's what we have to deal with. Two is that people have an abiding love for Mandela. Doubtless some news editors knew him, some reporters were inspired by him, and they know their readers adore him so they feel it is their duty to keep everyone as informed as possible.

Second, I think most people who read these stories are trying to come to grips with the fact that he will probably not make it through the day. He was a larger-than-life figure, and there will be billions of people mourning his passing. I've heard him described as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln combined to the South African people, and the national father. If your actual father were dying, you would certainly want to hear up-to-the-minute news on his condition. I think it is somewhat similar.

Tl;dr: The news organizations know that their stories will be read, and people love Mandela.

T1	Major_Claim 20 64	I don't think the Beatles were so great. CMV
T2	Value 74 113	a lot of their songs are sort of catchy
T3	Value 119 168	a lot of them I find are actually pretty terrible
T4	Value 170 261	A ton of them are formulaic as well, following basic song structures and chord progressions
T5	Value 263 289	Lyrics are rarely profound
T6	Value 292 479	I can see why people like them, but love for the Beatles is so disproportionately high compared to other British Invasion bands like the Who, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Clash, etc
T7	Value 481 519	Many of those bands innovated far more
T8	Value 522 641	I can also understand why they would have mass appeal, even today well after Beatlemania (and even with younger people)
T9	Value 643 653	I get that
T10	Value 659 767	I want someone to convince me why they are that much better, and why they deserve that excessive recognition

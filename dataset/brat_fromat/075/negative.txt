Your main fallacy is the current perspective.  You are listening to The Beatles after hearing thousands upon thousands of songs and bands that were influenced by their work (both directly and trickle-down).  

At the time in America chart-topping music was slow, boring, religious, safe, and fairly sterile ([check it\)](http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/top-100-songs-of-the-year/?year=1959).  

The Beatles were different and that's exactly what the youth of America was looking for.

Did more talented artists exist... yep.
Are The Beatles the most original band ever... nope.
Does a lot of it amount to "the right place at the right time"... yep.
Are teenagers fickle and cling to popularity... super-yep.

BUT... They kicked the door open for other (even better) bands to even exist.  

Nothing is original.  We are telling the same basic stories in today's blockbuster films that we told each other in smoldering caves.  Popular does not equal good.  Good does not equal popular, but there is no denying the influence The Beatles have had over the past six decades.  Greatness is defined by your mark on history, not necessarily your actual ability.

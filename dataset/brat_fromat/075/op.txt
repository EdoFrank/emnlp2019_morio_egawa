op_title: I don't think the Beatles were so great. CMV

I mean, a lot of their songs are sort of catchy, but a lot of them I find are actually pretty terrible. A ton of them are formulaic as well, following basic song structures and chord progressions. Lyrics are rarely profound.

I can see why people like them, but love for the Beatles is so disproportionately high compared to other British Invasion bands like the Who, Yes, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Clash, etc. Many of those bands innovated far more.

I can also understand why they would have mass appeal, even today well after Beatlemania (and even with younger people). I get that. But I want someone to convince me why they are that much better, and why they deserve that excessive recognition.

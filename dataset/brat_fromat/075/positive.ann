T1	Value 66 267	The main problem with this reasoning is that you're looking at the Beatles from our current perspective as opposed to looking at what they did from the perspective of someone who was around at the time
T2	Value 411 623	When the Beatles entered the scene (I wasn't around at the time, so this is taken from anecdotal evidence), much of the popular music was akin to what the Beatles released on Please Please Me, their first release
T3	Value 625 721	It was practically unheard of (at the time) for artists to progress the way that the Beatles did
T4	Value 747 911	I cannot think of a single artist that progressed as quick and as vast as they did in as little time, while still holding onto what made their music uniquely theirs
T5	Value 915 1261	There are very few artists that can reach a point where they can create both [I Wanna Hold Your Hand](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_csEEI4PFE) and [Tomorrow Never Knows](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spjcPS4ekOA)(two very different songs, I admit, and perhaps not perfectly exemplary of their body of work at large) in a way that is...natural
T6	Value 1263 1300	They progressed as opposed to mutated
T7	Value 1304 1577	Along with that comes the fact that bands like Radiohead would not have existed at the time (that is to say, experimental bands that still achieved large mainstream appeal) and would arguably never had achieved mainstream success or even existed were it not for the Beatles
T8	Value 1579 1641	They are widely considered trailblazers in this regard exactly
T9	Value 1650 1747	they did go there and by doing so paved the way for other bands to do what they did, only more so
T10	Value 1760 1842	there has never been a band that has had as big a cultural impact before and since
T11	Value 1844 1885	People would maybe argue Elvis in America
T12	Value 1891 1936	I would personally put the Beatles above that
T13	Testimony 2131 2218	I also did some research on the cultural impact the Beatles had on Liverpool and London
T14	Value 2224 2240	it is remarkable
T15	Value 2276 2460	if you look purely at the quality of music that the Beatles produced you should be able to see that they have produced an enormous amount of arguably high quality music in a short time
T16	Value 2466 2493	the other bands know it too
T17	Fact 2495 2665	The Who stated they were highly influenced by the Beatles (and the Beatles by them in return, just listen to [Helter Skelter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueBUFUWSXHs))
T18	Value 2690 2793	you can definitely hear some Beatles influences in both Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, albeit more subtle
T19	Value 2795 3014	They were way before their time in a way that no other band has been able to emulate, be it in musical quality, diversity of material, evolution, quality and volume of music produced in a short timespan, and mass appeal
T20	Value 3016 3132	There has simply not been a band that has been able to deliver this complete package in the way that the Beatles did

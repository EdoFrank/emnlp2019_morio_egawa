op_title: I think it's economically and socially irresponsible to have children right now. Please CMV.

First I want to explain *why* I need this view changed: I like children, a lot. So does my live-in boyfriend and soon to be fiance, and we've been discussing having them a few years down the line. We're financially responsible, and net in about 30K a year together. No food stamps, just simple living, etc. This would be an adventure we'd take in our late twenties, and we're only early/mid twenties now.

The problem is, when I look at the future, I am absolutely terrified for any future kids of mine. I certainly can't afford a degree for them, I can barely afford one for ME. I find our public school system lacking and the job market lacking any more. Connections were the only thing that got me this job, I don't think blindly fishing works anymore.

I'm very happy about the advancement of medicine, antibiotics, hospital care. I know my child will be healthy... but happy? I'm not sure.

Racism, classism and other bigotries still run rampant. Violence is everywhere, I can't walk around at night comfortably without packing heat. We're both white, so I suppose I shouldn't worry about the racism bit, but what if I have a gay or lesbian child? What if they're mentally ill? What if they're smaller and weaker? I feel like I can't protect them.

This may seem strange but I am sincerely already scared for a child I don't yet have... But I would love children and so would my boyfriend. Please give me some hope, or tell me what I can do to stop problems before they start. 

Note: I live in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.

Biggest concerns:

* horrific job market

* even worse public school system

* inability to pay for college

* archaic society

EDIT: Just realized I should probably add this. I'm going to work now, but I'll be back online in about eight hours or so to answer replies.

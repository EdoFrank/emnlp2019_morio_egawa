Some economists and CEOs (such as Steve Jobs, I believe) talk about "spending through a recession", where you keep hiring and developing even as the market plunges, so that when the market recovers you are in a far stronger position than competitors who cut back on staff and research.

And it's like that for the human race as well, because you now have an opportunity to raise a child in an environment where they'll learn values of spending money wisely, the use of restraint, perspective, and humility.

IE: we could really use a generation that can compensate for the the "spoiled brat" era of Tiger Moms, Helicopter Parents, and Little Emperors.

You may feel that our society is archaic and bigoted, but gay marriage and black presidents were inconceivable only one generation ago. And you may feel that the public school system is terrible, but we also have things like [Kahn Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org), and [Open Courseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), which were also unheard of a decade ago.

The economy will get better, but it may be hampered if there's a void in the demographics by the time we get there.

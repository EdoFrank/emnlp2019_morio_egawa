Most people hate the public school system, but are very happy with their own local schools.  It turns out that if you omit schools with high poverty rates, our schools are actually doing pretty well.  That said, if you are ideologically opposed to the public school system, you are free to opt out.  Every state in the U.S. allows homeschooling, although the requirements vary for each.

People are beginning to predict that the higher education bubble will burst due to the skyrocketing college tuition rates and the explosion of free open courseware available, and that it's very possible that by the time your children are college-aged, paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for a college education may be largely obsolete.

Progress is slow in our society, but it is getting better.  The high school that my parents went to was not desegregated until their senior year.  Now, any children that you ever have will never know what it's like to live in a world where only straight white men can be president of the U.S.  I've watched many people in my parents' generation change their views on interracial marriage as their children and their friends' children married those of other races.  The tide is turning the other way toward acceptance of homosexuality as well.  Look at the worldwide outrage directed at Russia recently.

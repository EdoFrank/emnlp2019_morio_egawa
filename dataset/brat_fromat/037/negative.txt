op_title: I believe that the media has a liberal bias CMV

Your source doesn't exactly seem that neutral on this subject, and I'm having a hard time finding numbers on this that aren't from a conservative/Republican source.

But I also have a question: what differences are there in the way a liberal bias manifests versus a conservative one? I ask because other than MSNBC and the much larger FOX, I don't see that many that aren't a blog or somesuch, where the bias is blatant. How many are simply a more-or-less neutral outlet that one might read a scattered article and detect some kind of bias one way or the other? by what metric do you decide an entire outlet or journalist to be biased as opposed to the assemblage of facts on a single article?

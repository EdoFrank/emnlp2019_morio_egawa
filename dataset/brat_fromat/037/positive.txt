Did you ever consider that the news is biased but not in a left/right way?

There's a "sensationalism bias" where news outlets try to find news that is exciting while ignoring important, yet mundane or complex stories.

There's a "pander to your audience" bias, where news organizations try to please their audience rather than educate them.

There's a "pre existing narrative" bias where news organizations alter stories to fit what most people believe or want to believe.

There's a "don't upset our sponsor" bias where news organizations will ignore or downplay stories which cast their advertisers in a bad light.

Sure some outlets are explicitly liberal or conservative but IMO these are the bigger forms of media bias.

op_title: I believe that the media has a liberal bias CMV

Everyone is biased one way or another. I don't believe that either the left or right side of politics is completely right - I'm not claiming that they are equal - just that when you are in a bubble it is easy to not understand the other side's point of view.

Now, I believe that journalists, despite their best efforts, will exhibit some degree of bias too. This will lead to the majority of the media having a liberal bias, since most journalists are [liberal](http://www.freakonomics.com/2011/08/08/tim-groseclose-author-of-left-turn-answers-your-questions/). Of course, some outlets (Fox news) have a heavy conservative bias. I'm not claiming that the liberal bias is anywhere near as large as many conservatives would have you believe, just that it exists

T1	Value 163 198	he is not by definition a socialist
T2	Value 200 276	he advocates for socialist variations of domestic policy, to varying extents
T3	Value 280 380	The real problem with your argument, while both reasonable and rational, comes in the last paragraph
T4	Value 630 654	This just isn't the case
T5	Value 670 793	Economically, socialism doesn't allow for capital-based transactions, and directly opposes supply and demand based thinking
T6	Value 795 957	This means two key things: profits don't exist, and instead of valuing things via the market, products are valued by the amount of production it took to make them
T7	Value 959 983	Capital no longer exists
T8	Value 997 1370	while companies would no longer enjoy profit margins, neither would the workers: revenue would be sufficient enough (theoretically, assuming Marx was wrong and that his Exploitation of the Worker and/or Alienation of the Worker from Products won't occur in a capital-based system) to continue operation and ensure workers receive the minimum sustenance they need to survive
T9	Value 1383 1425	there *wouldn't* be liquid assets anywhere
T10	Value 1468 1576	if there were, it would be because companies were proving Marx's predictions true and exploiting the workers
T11	Value 1621 1662	our budget is stretched historically thin
T12	Fact 1664 1815	Federal debt is rising fast (http://www.federalbudget.com/) and many of the social programs will become more expensive as the baby boomers become older
T13	Fact 1819 2021	As these programs' pricetags are set to only increase (http://www.aging.senate.gov/crs/ss4.pdf), simultaneously increasing other programs will only, if under current budgeting, increase the mess further
T14	Value 2031 2063	there is no money left to create
T15	Value 2065 2219	Even so, if we raised the payroll taxes that fund Social Security and the funds that give into Medicare/Medicaid, the primary sufferers would be employers
T16	Value 2221 2335	This would lessen small business's ability to operate, and allow only big businesses to reign supreme, so to speak
T17	Value 2381 2554	it is neither theoretically nor practically possible for us to adapt more Marxist/Socialist policies without hurting, to some extent, either workers or small business owners
T18	Value 2556 2702	It would only cause big business to profit more, and give them greater incentive (&amp; arguably, ability) to become (more) fraudulent and corrupt

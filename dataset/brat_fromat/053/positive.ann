T4	Value 314 389	I agree with your points on heath care and basic utilitys (internet i hope)
T5	Value 394 443	I really do disagree with you on higher education
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 488 585	I want to establish what parts or forms of socialism are effective and what parts are ineffective
T7	Value 587 689	The two sides of the scale are capitalism and communism(duh), and socialism is somewhere in the middle
T8	Value 704 834	socialism does not have anything unique about it, to be effective is must use some capitalist policies and some communist policies
T9	Value 836 898	If you try and split the difference you end up getting neither
T10	Value 900 994	The examples in the US are Medicare and Medicaid, Section 8, and more recently social security
T11	Value 996 1144	These are all government run programs that use a mix of Public and private funding and today are a drain on the gov. and increasingly less effective
T12	Value 1146 1374	You can have a socialist society where one sector, say heath care is under total government control(to provide it to everyone) or under all private control(to increase tech and keep prices low) than both will achieve there goals
T13	Value 1376 1534	By extension this means that when you a a partially subsided or half government controlled sector then you end up with a mess, high prices low tech innovation
T14	Value 1537 1588	this referrers to government capital not regulation

T17	Fact 1782 1870	Only 30% ish of the people have the mental capacity to benefit for college ( Dorrel, 11)
T18	Value 1872 2041	This means that you would have to have the US government either supporting or carrying out tests that say, "You're in, and You're not" or they would just let everyone in
T19	Value 2043 2123	The former is unconstitutional and the latter is not realistic or cost effective
T20	Value 2128 2211	You have have no mix or government money without impacts that outweigh the benefits
T21	Value 2213 2270	Government money in a private sector will drive prices up
T22	Value 2275 2371	while the Gov. intentions were good the have actually created a bubble that will burst very soon
T23	Value 2376 2400	Government funding is ok
T24	Value 2405 2484	it would need to be done through a subsidy contingent upon low prices not loans
T25	Value 2489 2556	Government run colleges will halt scientific research as we know it
T26	Value 2563 2662	despite student loans, there is stem cell, cancer, biochemical and other kinds of research going on
T27	Value 2664 2787	If the government took over the schools any tech advancement could be grabbed, halted, weaponized kept away from the public
T28	Value 2789 2869	This possibility halts advancement in general and would hurt humanity as a whole

op_title: I believe *more* socialism is needed for the U.S. to prosper CMV

In spite of the cries from some media sources that Obama is a socialist and that socialism is bad, I firmly believe the opposite is true.  Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper.

In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc.  we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water.

I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now.  New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order ($78/week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family.

Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities.  I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service.  The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity.  No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change.  I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation.

The only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies.  I think advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on.

Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom.

[**Edit**: I understand that this isn't *exactly* socialism... but it's a lot closer than what we have now.]

[**Edit 2 - Clarification**: My idea of "publicly-owned" is more along the lines of a [Utility Cooperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_cooperative) where "Each customer is a member and owner of the business with an equal say as every other member of the cooperative, unlike investor-owned utilities where the amount of say is governed by the number of shares held". I am *not* necessarily advocating utilities be "government-run"]

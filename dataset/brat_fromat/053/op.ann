T1	Major_Claim 20 84	I believe *more* socialism is needed for the U.S. to prosper CMV
T2	Value 86 222	In spite of the cries from some media sources that Obama is a socialist and that socialism is bad, I firmly believe the opposite is true
T3	Value 225 337	Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper
T4	Policy 340 607	In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc.  we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water
T5	Testimony 610 779	I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now
T6	Value 782 873	New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus
T7	Value 887 990	broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium

T12	Testimony 1464 1564	No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change
T13	Policy 1575 1673	these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation
T14	Value 1746 1827	private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies
T15	Value 1838 1941	advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on
T16	Value 1944 2185	Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom

T1	Value 65 87	You're generally right
T2	Value 88 210	it is stereotyping to assume that someone is of a certain gender based on what activities they enjoy and it isn't accurate
T3	Value 221 251	that isn't really how it works
T4	Testimony 254 361	I'm a trans guy and I like a lot of different things: a lot are 'masculine dudebro' things and a lot aren't
T5	Testimony 363 509	In the course of a single day I can spend hours playing video games, reading or watching shitty TV shows ranging from Pawn Stars to Hannah Montana
T6	Value 511 569	I don't regard any of these things as 'female' parts of me
T7	Testimony 571 591	I am inherently male
T8	Value 593 651	There is not other way to describe it; it is just who I am
T9	Value 665 756	I am a man the same way that I know that I am attracted to women or anything else intuitive
T10	Value 758 797	It's absolutely integral to my identity
T11	Value 801 977	If I were to put on a dress it wouldn't tap into some female part of me because of some ridiculous notion of gender roles, I would just be a really uncomfortable man in a dress
T12	Value 1035 1124	you have never known societal discomfort until you have lived a day with Gender Dysphoria
T13	Value 1126 1262	Hearing 'ma'am' or 'miss' all day every day is the kind of thing that can just make you want to lay down and die as a transgender person
T14	Value 1266 1341	It may seem shallow and unnecessary to pander to what society expects of us
T15	Value 1346 1374	there are two reasons for it
T16	Value 1376 1598	one is that stereotypes are absolutely based in factâ€”they are really just a variation on what psychologists call 'schemas' or really quick bullet points about something that your brain can pull out at the mention of a word
T17	Rhetorical_Statement 1610 1704	all those little pictures we get in our mind when someone says 'little old lady' or 'Scotsman'
T18	Value 1706 1809	The reason these exist is that they are based on truth and are your brain's way of saving a bit of time
T19	Value 1818 1926	memorising each individual aspect of each individual little old lady or Scotsman you meet is a daunting task
T20	Value 1930 2131	These are only detrimental if we grow to rely on them too much and don't allow them to adapt or expect everyone to fit accurately into our schema which will accurately describe only a handful of people
T21	Value 2146 2200	gender roles are a schema: girls do this, boys do that
T22	Value 2246 2397	they are absolutely accurate as a *generalisation* which is why you will find that many trans people do fit these stereotypes of their true gender well
T23	Value 2399 2438	Some things fit people and others don't
T24	Value 2443 2573	as a whole we don't do a half bad job of distinguishing girls and boys (assuming we don't argue that these ideas are set in stone)
T25	Value 2584 2702	there are people on the absolute opposite end of the spectrum: outliers who don't fit into any of their gender's roles
T26	Value 2704 2775	This doesn't make their dysphoria and need to transition any less valid
T27	Value 2822 2870	I strongly disagree with the war on gender roles
T28	Value 2872 3002	used correctly there is absolutely nothing wrong with them (they should, of course, never be forced on someone against their will)
T29	Value 3004 3130	They exist for a reason, that reason being that they are fairly prevalent and our brain has decided 'Aha, I should file that!'
T30	Value 3140 3201	that doesn't mean that there isn't a huge spectrum in between
T31	Value 3203 3284	It's just a basic starting point for what our brain associates with men and women
T32	Value 3287 3401	The second reason is that, for our emotional well-being, us trans folks absolutely *need* to be gendered correctly
T33	Value 3403 3432	It is pivotal to our survival
T34	Value 3443 3500	there is a huge need to 'pass' within the trans community
T35	Value 3502 3608	the easiest way to do this is to dress and act ways that are typical of the gender they want to be seen as
T36	Value 3610 3710	It is a sad fact that people make brash judgments based on what we wear and how we present ourselves
T37	Value 3721 3902	getting the average person who has never thought about gender in their life to consider that gender is really on the inside and not the outside is going to be a long and hard battle
T38	Value 3913 3941	it is just easier to conform
T39	Value 3947 4080	realistically it is not viable for a trans man wearing make up and showing their breasts to be seen as male to the general population
T40	Value 4081 4157	whether it should be or not is controversial even within the trans community
T41	Value 4190 4318	it is not that a person who fits female stereotypes *must* be a woman or that a person who fits male stereotypes *must* be a man
T42	Value 4320 4439	it is that these people are women/men and as such align with some (but generally not all) of the tropes of their gender
T43	Value 4448 4489	they are rooted, to some extent, in truth
T44	Value 4492 4529	I hope this is somewhat useful to you

T3	Testimony 234 259	that was what my body was
T4	Value 261 562	I was always confused as to why some people felt so strongly about their gender, or why people would want to identify as something else (outside of changing the physical appearance more towards the general appearance of the opposite sex which I always assumed was for cosmetic purposes and I embraced)

T13	Testimony 1366 1392	I realized how people felt
T14	Testimony 1393 1470	I tried to explore within myself to see where I fell and what I identified as
T15	Testimony 1472 1532	I realized after a long time of soul searching that I didn't
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 1534 1547	I just didn't
T17	Value 1559 1643	I feel like a man, sometimes I feel like a woman, most of the time I feel in between
T18	Value 1650 1699	that's what caused me to not understand the issue
T19	Value 1702 1759	I'm not saying that this is the same for you by any means
T20	Policy 1771 1813	it's worth doing some soul searching about

op_title: I dislike gender identity as a concept. CMV.

To start with, a disclaimer. I consider myself agendered and don't identify as a gender one way or the other. For the longest time I "identified" as male simply because that was what my body was. I was always confused as to why some people felt so strongly about their gender, or why people would want to identify as something else (outside of changing the physical appearance more towards the general appearance of the opposite sex which I always assumed was for cosmetic purposes and I embraced). It wasn't until I got involved in the lgbt community due to my sexual preferences and got close to several transgendered individuals that I realized what I was missing. Everyone has this core identity, this idea of who they are. This doesn't mean that they view certain things as "manly" or not, it's just that they view themselves at their core as a man or a woman. It's like saying I'm white, or that I'm a geek, or that I like tacos. It's just a thing that is an integral part of them. Things became "manly" because people who identified strongly as a male would stereotypically follow that pattern (sidenote: stereotypes are based off of perceived averages and oftentimes are mostly useful for marketing purposes. I recognize that individuals fall along WAY more boundaries) and vice versa. 

Once I realized how people felt I tried to explore within myself to see where I fell and what I identified as. I realized after a long time of soul searching that I didn't. I just didn't. Sometimes I feel like a man, sometimes I feel like a woman, most of the time I feel in between...and that's what caused me to not understand the issue.

I'm not saying that this is the same for you by any means, but maybe it's worth doing some soul searching about?

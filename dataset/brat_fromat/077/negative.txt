op_title: I don't think that dropping my Gifted 10th Grade Literature class for a regular english class is a bad idea. CMV

If you are only in the class it is better that you drop. Receiving high marks in the regular English class will look better than bombing your GPA for the "more prestigious" English. Since you've mentioned it isn't AP or anything that colleges even care about a bit there it really isn't any reason to stay.

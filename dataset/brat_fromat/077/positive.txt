You're not going to look back at yourself in 5 years and say "I'm so glad I took an easy english class"

You are somewhat likely to look back in 5 years and say "I regret taking the easy way through school".

I obviously don't know, but I imagine this workload isn't quite as bad as you think it is.  Stay focused on making constant progress, and if that isn't enough talk to the teacher (showing you've made progress) and ask for a little more time.

op_title: I don't think that dropping my Gifted 10th Grade Literature class for a regular english class is a bad idea. CMV

I'm a Sophomore who finished Freshman year with As and Bs (with two gifted classes, Literature and Biology)
I only learned I had this class the first day of school and did none of the required summer work because of this. ( I have until labor day to read two books, do two essays, and do two projects)
A very significant Girl (to me) is in this class and I only have one other period with her and she is the only reason I haven't dropped it yet. 
I would actually like to have this class, but the amount of work being piled on me is really stressing me out and it's only the first week of school.
So, uh. CMV?

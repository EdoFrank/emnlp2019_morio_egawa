op_title: I believe that passing your genes to the next generation is important. CMV

I've had my view since I learned about evolution. Now I'm question its validity.

It started with [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fiqba/2_year_old_problems_cinnamon_rolls_arent_instant/caapf9x?context=3), I think started a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fiy64/question_how_do_you_feel_knowing_that_you_wont_be/) on /r/childfree but no one came up with a reason good enough to change my view, then again, I don't think they were trying so it's up to you guys.

I just find it very hard to believe that someone doesn't want to pass on their genes, I mean, it's what all our ancestors have lived for, it's what all animals live for, heck, some spiders let the female eat them just so they have better chances of passing on their genes.

It's the sole purpose of our existence (in addition to any other purposes we have for ourselves). It bothers me to no end that many generations ago passing on our genes was important but now that we're more intelligent we're CHOOSING to not pass on our genes.

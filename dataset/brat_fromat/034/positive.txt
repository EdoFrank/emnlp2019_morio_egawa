op_title: I believe that passing your genes to the next generation is important. CMV

It's BECAUSE we're intelligent that we don't want to pass on our genes (or more accurately, we don't value the gene passing enough to be subjected to the responsibility and other negatives of bringing up a child.) 

We acknowledge that if a trend emerges where the best humans choose not to procreate then we will weaken or even die as a species, but we now have the intelligence to decide we're apathetic to the fate of our species past our own short meaningless lives. 

It's selfish, but that is what evolution is all about. We're just using it for another reason than survival, because we have that luxury. 

In short, **it is** bad for humanity to do what we are doing, but we know we are not actually gaining anything from the success of our species past our own time, so why should we suffer on a personal level to help?

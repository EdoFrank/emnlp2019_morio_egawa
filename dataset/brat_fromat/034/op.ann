T1	Major_Claim 20 94	I believe that passing your genes to the next generation is important. CMV
T2	Value 96 144	I've had my view since I learned about evolution
T3	Value 605 677	it very hard to believe that someone doesn't want to pass on their genes
T4	Value 687 864	it's what all our ancestors have lived for, it's what all animals live for, heck, some spiders let the female eat them just so they have better chances of passing on their genes
T5	Value 867 963	It's the sole purpose of our existence (in addition to any other purposes we have for ourselves)
T6	Value 965 1125	It bothers me to no end that many generations ago passing on our genes was important but now that we're more intelligent we're CHOOSING to not pass on our genes

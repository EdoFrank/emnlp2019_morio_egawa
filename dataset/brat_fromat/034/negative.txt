Animals don't have sex because they want to pass on their genes - they have sex because they want orgasms and the satisfaction of their instincts.  Evolution has created these rewards as a mechanism to compel animals to reproduce in order to create a reason to pass on their genes.  When I say animals, I can even include humans in that.  After all, many people are "accidents" - children born only because their parents wanted to have sex, not because they felt a need to pass on their genes.  Also, many children are born because their parents had an instinctual desire to have a child.  These children were not born because their parents wanted to ensure that their genes were passed on, but because of inbuilt instinct developed by natural selection.

I think that individuals who are under 18 should be eligible to vote provided they pass a test that would demonstrate they have clear understanding and knowledge of political issues. Minors that are willing to make the extra effort of taking a test (that citizens over 18 don't do) should be able to vote as their vote would be just as valid and educated as adult citizens.

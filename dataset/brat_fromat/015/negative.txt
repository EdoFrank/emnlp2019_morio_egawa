I disagree on account that, before the age of 18 you are not considered an adult yet. Children in highschool *think* that they're mature and that who they vote for now, will be the same way they think in 4 years however that's probably not the case. I don't feel they're intelligent enough yet, or have the experience necessary. Lowering the drinking age to 18? I'm ok with. Lowering the voting age to 15, 16? No. The last thing we need is a politician pandering to 16 year olds with immaturity

Validity of opinion is not part of the democratic process. That's sort of the point - it doesn't matter if you're thick or not, you have just as many rights as your fellow citizen. What you're proposing is that under 18's who are intelligent deserve more rights than the unintelligent.

Furthermore, how exactly do you plan to quantify "understanding and knowledge" - it is totally subjective. If you study history, even modern history you aren't presented with a single interpretation of the facts and told "that's how it happened", there's dozens of different equally valid interpretations of a single event. Take a modern example, the Global Financial Crisis - was this caused by poor regulation of the banks by governments, or by people borrowing beyond their means, or by a global Jewish conspiracy. You can't really refute any of those options with complete certainty - so how on Earth can you test someone on it?

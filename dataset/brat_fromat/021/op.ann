T1	Major_Claim 20 53	I am an existential nihilist. CMV
T2	Value 74 289	I'd like to define the term existential nihilism as the belief that life has no intrinsic meaning or purpose, and nothing that anybody does (or that the human race does as a whole) will matter at all in the long run
T3	Value 304 468	based on this definition, changing my view on only one of the two qualifiers would change my opinion on the matter, as existential nihilism requires both to be true
T4	Value 497 701	when I say "nothing will matter at all in the long run" I'm not talking about the differences that humanity will cause in terms of releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere or something of similar vein
T5	Value 715 873	humanity will never accomplish a worthwhile goal, one that will result in life having reached its predetermined objective or have truly 'succeeded' in any way

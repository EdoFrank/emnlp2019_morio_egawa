op_title: I am an existential nihilist. CMV

So far as we can currently understand, all life is cancer; self-perpetuating simply because it does.

My argument against absolute certainty in existential nihilism is the belief that increasingly novel arrangements of materials and ideas represent the only kind of progress that is *potentially* meaningful to intelligent beings. If there really exists any 'meaning' behind intelligent life, all previous formations of human society and ideas produced have not found it. 

Thus, *meaningful* progress if there is any to be had, can only be found in directions unexplored. Forward advancements in science encapsulate all past scientific knowledge. Forward advancements in technology obsolete all past related-technologies. Forward development of moral valuations  invalidate all past systems of morality. So long as it does exist, humanity's only legitimate goal is to build on upon everything 'previous' in order to accomplish novel progress. An intelligent mind sees no other alternative. 

Future formations of human life and intelligence can only be *potentially* meaningful so long as they are different than all that came before. Given the choice between zero and infinity, aim for infinity - even if infinity is incomprehensible. You and I already understand the meaning of zero, so why waste time on that?

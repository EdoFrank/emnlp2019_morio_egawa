op_title: I believe that antidepressants mess you up and addict you in the long term because without them you are back to the "reality" goggles. CMV

I've been depressed for a long time but I'm still a few months away from adulthood. I live in a small society where going to therapists is largely criticized. I'll move away from home in four to five months and I've been seriously considering going to a therapist. 

My problem stems from the fact that I hear so much about how antidepressants make you "better" but to me it seems like those people sound like drug addicts. "when I'm on my pills in happy but when I'm not I'm all grumpy!" I'm sorry but if I felt that my life depended on a bottle of pills then I'd get more depressed. 

my friends don't take depression seriously and those who do think it gets better by telling me that "I should look on the bright side of life" but to me that sounds like straight up bullcrap. I'm saying this because I don't believe depression is reality; it's just much closer to reality.

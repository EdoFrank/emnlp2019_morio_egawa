Whoever tells you that is being irresponsible or has never taken anti-depressants.  Xanex will give you that instant-calmness and serenity, and it can be addictive if you take it more than you have to.  There are other drugs like it, but normal, run of the mill anti-depressants like Abilify and Prozac won't do that to you.  It's not as if you feel happy all the time, but it allows you to be able to feel happy at all.

Depression isn't always prolonged melancholy--the most debilitating part of depression, I've found, is not finding any joy in anything.  Allowing your brain to feel positive sensations again is what I think should be the goal of taking anti-depressants.  

In short, I think your view of anti-depressants as happy-pills that make you magically better is just as warped as everyone else's view of depression in your town.  Also, get a diagnosis from a therapist or psychiatrist before you say: "I've been depressed."  Depressed isn't a feeling, it's a state of mind and it's much more debilitating than just feeling sad.  It's extremely complex and taking a 10-point quiz online does not qualify you to say whether you're depressed or not.

When you have to make the decision between feeling like a pile of shit and watching your life flow down the drain and taking a pill every day or every other day, the choice will become crystal clear.  It's not an end-all-be-all--a lot of times, there's a reason you're depressed, but being unstuck by anti-depressants at least allows you to be able to work towards solving those issues.

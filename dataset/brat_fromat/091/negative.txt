op_title: I am a 21 year-old who is rapidly becoming a hermit/recluse. I don't necessarily see anything "wrong" with it.

It's not that it's wrong to be introverted, it's fine. I'm an introvert. I'm good with it.

That being said, life is better when you share it with others, even for an introvert. Suffering softened and success is sweeter when shared. Friends and family are important, and while it might not always be your favorite thing to do, if you care about them you'll make an effort to be a part of their lives. It will be difficult at times, but you owe it to them to be there for them and take and interest in what's going on.

It's also important to develop social skills. The subtleties and nuances of human interaction are complex and many. No matter how good you think you are, you need to be getting better at it. Whatever your job, whatever your interests, you will be better at your job and your hobbies if you are better with people. How do you do this? You talk to them. I know it's not always fun and it can be exhausting, but it's important to go out and interact with people. Years of reclusiveness puts you years behind others in terms of social development. 

You can always learn something from other people. Not in the preachy sense, but I'll assume you're not the lone expert on your field, so I can say that you will learn better and perform better if you can communicate better. And that takes practice. Always improve yourself.

Be a better man for yourself and for the people you care about, and part of being a better man is making an effort for others by being social.

op_title: I am a 21 year-old who is rapidly becoming a hermit/recluse. I don't necessarily see anything "wrong" with it.

When I was in high school I used to care a lot about how people perceived me. I didn't have many friends and was fairly shy and whatnot.

In college, during my freshman year, I thought I'd make changes to my life to become more sociable. Unfortunately, I didn't change much because I stayed at home for school to save money, and moreover, I was still fairly shy.

I'm in my last year and the pressure is beginning to pile up. Need a job, need research experience for grad school, still need to take tests, keep resume updated etc. On top of that, I want to keep my main hobby (writing) alive. 

I'm finding that making friends is becoming less of a priority. But at the same time, I'm seeing myself turn into an extreme hermit of sorts...what's troubling is that now I don't care.

Before I cared about appearances, having lots of friends...now I have like, literally, 1 or 2, and I hang out with them maybe...once every couple months. Otherwise I really don't hang out or go anywhere.

When I look at others, I can definitely tell that this is not supposed to be the norm. People go out on the weekends, have at least friends who text them about stuff that's not school related, go out to bars, have experiences.

I just don't care anymore, but I think this may be dangerous. My twenties are supposed to be vibrant, or at least that's what novels and movies say. Change my view. I don't really necessarily want to be a hermit anymore, but at the same time...my parents don't have friends. Older people I meet seem to not have friends. When I was growing up, most of my classmates' parents didn't have many friends. 

It seems that having friends and "doing life" is something reserved for the young...then people have families/get hitched and loose interest to 
go out.

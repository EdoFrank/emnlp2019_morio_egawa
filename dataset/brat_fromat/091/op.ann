T3	Testimony 210 267	I didn't have many friends and was fairly shy and whatnot
T4	Testimony 270 368	In college, during my freshman year, I thought I'd make changes to my life to become more sociable
T5	Testimony 385 405	I didn't change much
T6	Testimony 414 493	I stayed at home for school to save money, and moreover, I was still fairly shy
T7	Testimony 496 556	I'm in my last year and the pressure is beginning to pile up

T10	Value 727 789	I'm finding that making friends is becoming less of a priority
T11	Value 813 867	I'm seeing myself turn into an extreme hermit of sorts
T12	Value 870 911	what's troubling is that now I don't care
T13	Testimony 914 970	Before I cared about appearances, having lots of friends
T14	Testimony 973 1066	now I have like, literally, 1 or 2, and I hang out with them maybe...once every couple months
T15	Testimony 1068 1116	Otherwise I really don't hang out or go anywhere
T16	Value 1119 1204	When I look at others, I can definitely tell that this is not supposed to be the norm
T17	Value 1206 1344	People go out on the weekends, have at least friends who text them about stuff that's not school related, go out to bars, have experiences
T18	Value 1347 1372	I just don't care anymore

T24	Testimony 1668 1746	When I was growing up, most of my classmates' parents didn't have many friends
T25	Value 1750 1871	It seems that having friends and "doing life" is something reserved for the young...then people have families/get hitched

op_title: I believe that the band Nickelback gets far too much unwarranted hate. CMV.

From what I've heard, the internet hate comes from the sole truth that they sound just like any other alternative/pop/rock group you hear on the radio. In other words, they're not particularly unique, and there is little complexity behind their music. While this itself doesn't spark hate, the overwhelming popularity of such a simple band that sounds virtually the same as many other bands in the genre just tends to anger a lot of people.
Personally, I don't hate Nickelback. I can tolerate their music, it's not god-awful...but it's just irritating how they get more attention than bands in the genre that are far superior .

This seems to be how it started. Of course, the trendy "it's cool to hate Nickleback" just fans the flames.

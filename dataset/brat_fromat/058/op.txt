op_title: I believe that the band Nickelback gets far too much unwarranted hate. CMV.

I'm not a huge Nickelback fan in anyway, but I do listen to a few of their singles (Rock Star, Lullaby) regularly. They are a solid group; they have won several Junos and have held up as a band for almost 2 decades - people are listening to their music and enjoying it.

But as soon as I go on the internet, I am overcome by tons of people making fun of them, disliking their content on Youtube, and posting cancerous memes of various band members on sites like this and 9gag.

Unless I'm missing something crucial in the band's history, like hate mongering or a history of white supremacy advocation, I see no reason for people to jump on a bandwagon and hate this band. Not only that but people make extremely untasteful remarks about Chad Kroeger's recent marriage to Avril Lavigne. Avril in no way deserves any of the criticism associated with Nickelback - it has only come to light because of their marriage.

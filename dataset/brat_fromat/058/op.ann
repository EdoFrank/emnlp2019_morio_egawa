T1	Major_Claim 20 95	I believe that the band Nickelback gets far too much unwarranted hate. CMV.
T2	Testimony 97 126	I'm not a huge Nickelback fan
T3	Testimony 142 210	I do listen to a few of their singles (Rock Star, Lullaby) regularly
T4	Value 212 234	They are a solid group
T5	Fact 236 311	they have won several Junos and have held up as a band for almost 2 decades
T6	Value 314 365	people are listening to their music and enjoying it
T7	Value 372 572	as soon as I go on the internet, I am overcome by tons of people making fun of them, disliking their content on Youtube, and posting cancerous memes of various band members on sites like this and 9gag
T8	Value 575 767	Unless I'm missing something crucial in the band's history, like hate mongering or a history of white supremacy advocation, I see no reason for people to jump on a bandwagon and hate this band
T9	Value 769 881	Not only that but people make extremely untasteful remarks about Chad Kroeger's recent marriage to Avril Lavigne
T10	Value 883 955	Avril in no way deserves any of the criticism associated with Nickelback
T11	Value 958 1009	it has only come to light because of their marriage

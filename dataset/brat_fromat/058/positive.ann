T1	Value 97 120	I don't hate nickleback
T2	Value 133 220	it's sort of silly to hate something that you can pretty easily ignore if you choose to
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 223 288	I *hate* genocide, gang violence, school shootings, and neo-nazis
T4	Value 291 320	I *don't care for* Nickleback
T5	Value 342 394	Nickelback represents a change in the music industry
T6	Value 406 468	they were neither solely responsible or even the worst example
T7	Value 470 634	they were one of the first, most successful, and (perhaps most importantly) longest-living bands to come out of the late 90s / early 2000s mainstream music industry
T8	Value 637 742	Up until and somewhat through the 90s, there was a balance between artistic integrity and selling records
T9	Value 745 827	Obviously some people only cared about art, and some people only cared about money
T10	Value 833 952	there was a balance struck between both of these things that was kept for most of the 'big acts' you heard on the radio
T11	Value 955 1183	In many cases bands would put out one or two records under strict label control with "hitmaker" producers, and then once they proved themselves, they would be free to explore their artistic whims and put out really great records
T12	Value 1190 1281	even the early, "reigned in" records were often times still produced with a balance in mind
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1284 1299	Look at Nirvana
T14	Value 1302 1394	Their major label debut, "Nevermind", was terribly overproduced by the standards at the time
T15	Value 1400 1447	it still had a bit of artistic legitimacy to it
T16	Value 1459 1617	they put out "Incesticide" which didn't win them any friends at their label, followed by "In Utero", which was a really good balance of art and business sense
T17	Value 1620 1759	At some point, though, the major labels stopped caring about maintaining a balance and started only caring about efficiency in moving units
T18	Value 1762 1970	The "rock music" they were pushing was replaced with manufactured pop music produced over blandly written, contrived guitars designed to sound harder than traditionally pop but still be universally accessible
T19	Value 1973 2006	That's where Nickelback came from
T20	Value 2009 2037	That's where Creed came from
T21	Value 2040 2152	That's where basically every "new" band to emerge onto mainstream rock radio after the year 1996 or so came from
T22	Value 2179 2291	Nickelback was one of the first, most successful, and longest lived of the "new school" of mainstream radio rock
T23	Value 2294 2460	Because of this, their name has sort of become synonymous with all of these manufactured pop bands masquerading as rock and designed solely to move records as of late
T24	Value 2471 2538	it's inappropriate to hate them or make personal remarks about them
T25	Value 2548 2583	they're just some dudes doing a job
T26	Value 2589 2682	I can understand why people would have a strong distaste for their band as an artistic entity

op_title: I believe attempted murder and murder should be treated as the same crime. CMV

hypthetical: Someone makes me mad. I bring a gun to their house, and attempt to shoot them. This creates two scenarios: one where I shoot them in the head, killing them, and serve twenty years in jail. In the second I narrowly miss them, they call the cops, I'm arrested, and serve five. If the intent is the same, why should failed murder attempts be treated lesser than successful ones?

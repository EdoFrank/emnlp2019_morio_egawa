T1	Fact 118 243	legally the penalty for anything that does actual harm is much more severe, for example DUI vs impaired driving causing death
T2	Value 249 280	you present an interesting case
T3	Value 284 415	If I were a judge, I would justify the position by saying it's impossible to tell just how dead set a person was on killing another
T4	Value 417 561	It's entirely possible that something within you made the conscious decision at the last second to tilt your gun a little too high, and miss him
T5	Value 578 740	the Law would like to assume that nobody is inherently evil and that the difference between a failed murder and a successful one is one of character and restraint
T6	Value 752 778	this isn't always the case
T7	Value 784 958	you can see that when sentencing, a justice would prefer to have mercy on someone who went into that house intending to kill a man, but decided not to when push came to shove

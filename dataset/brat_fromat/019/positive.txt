op_title: I believe attempted murder and murder should be treated as the same crime. CMV

Having a lesser punishment for attempted murder incentivizes would-be murderers in the middle of carrying out their plans from following through because they know the punishment will be greatly reduced if they restrain themselves in the very end and don't actually kill someone.

Also attempted murder is a much harder crime to prove definitively than actual murder because it is difficult to definitively tell if someone was trying to kill a person or simply harm them. Both are bad but a less severe crime should have a less severe punishment and since it is less clear with attempted murder that the person wanted someone dead the punishment is less severe.

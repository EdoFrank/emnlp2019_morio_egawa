T3	Rhetorical_Statement 135 190	I bring a gun to their house, and attempt to shoot them
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 192 218	This creates two scenarios
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 230 300	I shoot them in the head, killing them, and serve twenty years in jail
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 316 386	I narrowly miss them, they call the cops, I'm arrested, and serve five

Interesting. Well legally the penalty for anything that does actual harm is much more severe, for example DUI vs impaired driving causing death. But you present an interesting case. 

If I were a judge, I would justify the position by saying it's impossible to tell just how dead set a person was on killing another. It's entirely possible that something within you made the conscious decision at the last second to tilt your gun a little too high, and miss him. I believe that the Law would like to assume that nobody is inherently evil and that the difference between a failed murder and a successful one is one of character and restraint. Of course this isn't always the case, but you can see that when sentencing, a justice would prefer to have mercy on someone who went into that house intending to kill a man, but decided not to when push came to shove.

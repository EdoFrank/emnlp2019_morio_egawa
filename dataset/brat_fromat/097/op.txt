op_title: [CMV] I think that life is not a journey, the only thing that matters is how much success you have in your life.

The only thing I care about in life is the end result. I don't want to fail at something a million times to "learn" to do something, I want success now. Each one of those failures only discourages me from trying harder. I can't enjoy failing like some people can. I'm sorry, but my drawings look like garbage, not a stepping stone to a greater me. And don't get me started with my success rate with women. 

In short, the only thing I really enjoy in life is success. Failure is discomforting, painful, and only serves to remind me of how bad my skills are. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, CMV.

How do you expect to gain success without risking failure?

Nobody enjoys failing. The reason people do it is either because they think the end goal is worth it or because they don't percieve themselves as failing. If we look at your examples, the practicing artist either thinks the drawing skill they gain will be worth it, or more likely they simply enjoy drawing in and of itself or think even their worse artworks are something to be proud of. Even men who are succesful with women get rejected more often than not, but they don't care because they know that if they make enough approachs they will be succesful eventually or they actually enjoy talking to women so the activity has more utility beyond sex/relationships.

op_title: [CMV] I think that life is not a journey, the only thing that matters is how much success you have in your life.

&gt; I can't enjoy failing like some people can. 

Guess what dude?  Nobody in the history of ever has enjoyed failing.  By definition it is not the outcome you wanted, and it just plain sucks.  

But I don't think that's your real problem.  If I had to take a guess (and I don't *really* have to, but I will anyway), I'd say that maybe your problem is that you've somehow gotten your sense of self-worth tied into your success or failure.  So then every time you fail at something, your mind is all like, "see, you're totally worthless and you might as well just crawl in a hole and die."  But everything seems awesome when you're succeeding.  

If, indeed, that is the issue, this is far beyond what a bunch of internet strangers can fix for you.  You could try therapy I guess--that seems to be the standard thing that people recommend for issues of this sort.  But I'm going to suggest something else, just for the sake of being different.  Go practice mindfulness meditation.  The whole point of this exercise is *literally* to focus on the journey, and your success at this exercise is determined largely by your ability to stop thinking about whether or not you're winning.  It will probably suck less if you can find a group of people to meditate with who will give you feedback. Groups like that tend to be around in lots of areas though.

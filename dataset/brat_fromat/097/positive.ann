T4	Value 335 373	I don't think that's your real problem
T5	Value 376 572	If I had to take a guess (and I don't *really* have to, but I will anyway), I'd say that maybe your problem is that you've somehow gotten your sense of self-worth tied into your success or failure
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 583 723	every time you fail at something, your mind is all like, "see, you're totally worthless and you might as well just crawl in a hole and die."

T8	Value 781 881	If, indeed, that is the issue, this is far beyond what a bunch of internet strangers can fix for you
T9	Policy 884 996	You could try therapy I guess--that seems to be the standard thing that people recommend for issues of this sort

T14	Value 1422 1480	Groups like that tend to be around in lots of areas though

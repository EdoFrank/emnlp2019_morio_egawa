T1	Rhetorical_Statement 117 143	Let me explain it this way
T2	Value 154 197	you're thinking of Superheroes too narrowly
T3	Value 207 319	you're thinking that most Superhero stories go along the lines of this: Bad guy appears, Superhero beats bad guy
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 322 380	That's just about the most boring storyline structure ever
T5	Value 386 491	that's the problem with your analysis: you think that a Superhero is defined by how he fights the bad guy
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 494 594	Let me present you an alternative view of why Superman is so appealing: He is our fantasy of justice
T7	Value 596 681	He's our fantasy answering the question: What if "good" were endowed with Superpowers
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 684 891	Given all the evil and terrible things in the world we live in, *what if* there were some really good guy that represents all our greatest hopes for humanity, with Superpowers that can put *everything* right
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 894 954	Grant Morrison put it in a much better way than I ever could
T10	Value 963 1111	we chose not to deconstruct the superhero but to take him at face value, as a fiction that was trying to tell us something wonderful about ourselves
T11	Value 1113 1202	Somewhere, in our darkest night, we made up the story of a man who will never let us down
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1222 1250	it all derived from Superman
T13	Value 1260 1374	I love all the characters, but Superman is just this perfect human pop-culture distillation of a really basic idea
T14	Rhetorical_Statement 1376 1391	He's a good guy
T15	Rhetorical_Statement 1393 1404	He loves us
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 1406 1438	He will not stop in defending us
T17	Rhetorical_Statement 1440 1462	How beautiful is that?
T18	Rhetorical_Statement 1463 1487	He's like a sci-fi Jesus
T19	Rhetorical_Statement 1489 1513	He'll never let you down
T20	Value 1519 1562	only in fiction can that guy actually exist
T21	Value 1572 1625	real guys will always let you down one way or another
T22	Value 1627 1669	We actually made up an idea that beautiful
T23	Value 1671 1693	That's just cool to me
T24	Value 1695 1757	We made a little paper universe where all of the above is true
T25	Rhetorical_Statement 1760 1811	We don't want to see Superman struggle (physically)
T26	Rhetorical_Statement 1813 1835	We want to see him win
T27	Rhetorical_Statement 1837 1915	We want to see him save people, smile, and fly off to solve some other problem
T28	Rhetorical_Statement 1917 2027	We want to see him beat the crap out of evil aliens, and effortlessly round up the most dangerous of criminals
T29	Rhetorical_Statement 2029 2066	We want to see good triumph over evil
T30	Value 2069 2096	Superman is basically Jesus
T31	Value 2098 2233	He's God in the sense of omnipotence and in the sense of the greatest good, having just enough humanity to connect and make sense to us
T32	Value 2235 2481	That last bit is really important: the fact that deep down, he's just good ol' Clark Kent, raised on the farm with the best of parents, wants to help everyone, and *just happens to have superpowers* reminds us that we have that goodness within us
T33	Value 2483 2541	Humanity is also capable of that level of good and charity
T34	Rhetorical_Statement 2548 2683	now that we've established that Superman is no ordinary Superhero, let's answer your question: What makes an interesting Superman story
T35	Value 2686 2749	The answer is: not one where he can beat the bad guy physically
T36	Rhetorical_Statement 2752 2776	I'll give you an example
T37	Value 2790 2924	Superman is raised in Soviet Russia instead of America, and basically tries to altruistically take over the world and spread communism
T38	Value 2958 3080	He restrains himself as he hopes that people will realize how much better Communism is (as ruled by an altrustic Superman)
T39	Value 3086 3241	over time he decides he just needs to take the reins, until Lex forces him to realize that he's basically playing god and humanity no longer has any agency
T40	Value 3243 3310	He ultimately realizes that he must let humanity choose its own way
T41	Value 3338 3382	"Luthor" is a pretty good Superman story too
T42	Value 3384 3435	Except it barely even stars Superman saving the day
T43	Value 3437 3581	It revolves around Luthor's genuine fear that Superman, in being this godlike figure on Earth, completely cripples mankind's ability to progress
T44	Value 3590 3707	they see this *alien*, faster, stronger, more capable than they'll *ever* be, and there's nothing left for them to do
T45	Value 3709 3771	Luthor and Superman represent two different ideals of humanity
T46	Value 3808 4079	Whereas Luthor represents the peak capability of humanity (Lex is at peak human intelligence and presumably physical training, at the forefront of business, technology and politics, and a complete master of his own fate), Superman represents the greatest good in humanity
T47	Value 4081 4158	accentuated by the fact that he has godly powers but uses them altruistically
T48	Rhetorical_Statement 4168 4196	what's a bad Superman story?
T49	Rhetorical_Statement 4197 4245	I don't know, the Death of Superman or something
T50	Rhetorical_Statement 4247 4322	Oh look, it's Superman, fighting this monster that's stronger than Superman
T51	Rhetorical_Statement 4324 4347	Greaaaat storyline guys
T52	Policy 4350 4513	If you want to read a story about a guy with gadgets or some cool power fighting cool villains, look elsewhere, at Batman or Green Lantern of Iron Man or something
T53	Value 4515 4559	Superman is much more endearing and enduring
T54	Value 4568 4662	he's now about fights and monsters, he's about the grand vision and greatest hopes of humanity
T55	Value 4664 4787	In his best stories, you walk away believing that some great moral principle has been won (or lost, depending on the story)
T56	Value 4797 4886	Superman isn't your generic Superhero, who just needs to fight a bad guy and save the day
T57	Value 4888 4923	He's better thought of as a concept
T58	Value 4929 5072	his best comics don't involve Superhero fighting Supervillain, they involve the ideas behind Superman and the ideas behind his villain clashing

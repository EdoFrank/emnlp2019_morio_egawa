op_title: I feel like Superman is the most Mary Sueish hero, and I do not understand his popularity. CMV.

Superman, to me, encompasses perfection. He's strong, fast, can fly, has pretty much every power under the sun that's textbook superhero fare, a very specific, and hackneyed weakness. 

His villains are generally more interesting than he is, but unlike Batman, who in my opinion acts more like a foil for the villains to be more pronounced on, Superman just allows any character his villains have to bounce off his chiseled countenance as he effortlessly pounds them into the ground.

Yet every time a game featuring him comes around, he's perfect, every time a movie comes around, generally he's perfect. Hell, even in the most recent iteration, it took someone who was EXACTLY the same as him to even stand a remote chance against Superman in combat. He doesn't even have a power source that can be disabled (the Red Sun), so he's always super powerful when he's on Earth or in the Solar System, which is almost all the time.

He feels like the most uncreative hero ever, but he's loved by EVERYONE, and I simply do not understand why.

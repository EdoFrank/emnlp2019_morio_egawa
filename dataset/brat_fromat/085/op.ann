T1	Major_Claim 20 115	I feel like Superman is the most Mary Sueish hero, and I do not understand his popularity. CMV.
T2	Value 117 156	Superman, to me, encompasses perfection
T3	Value 158 299	He's strong, fast, can fly, has pretty much every power under the sun that's textbook superhero fare, a very specific, and hackneyed weakness
T4	Value 303 357	His villains are generally more interesting than he is
T5	Value 363 599	unlike Batman, who in my opinion acts more like a foil for the villains to be more pronounced on, Superman just allows any character his villains have to bounce off his chiseled countenance as he effortlessly pounds them into the ground
T6	Value 602 721	Yet every time a game featuring him comes around, he's perfect, every time a movie comes around, generally he's perfect
T7	Value 729 868	even in the most recent iteration, it took someone who was EXACTLY the same as him to even stand a remote chance against Superman in combat
T8	Value 870 940	He doesn't even have a power source that can be disabled (the Red Sun)
T9	Value 945 1043	he's always super powerful when he's on Earth or in the Solar System, which is almost all the time
T10	Value 1046 1089	He feels like the most uncreative hero ever
T11	Value 1095 1153	he's loved by EVERYONE, and I simply do not understand why

op_title: I think that Obama has very little to do with the NSA/PRISM Scandal and should not be blamed. CMV

   Most people directly turn against Obama when it comes to PRISM. I feel like other people were much more involved. Everyone just blames everything on him when he barely has anything to do with anything. What about congress? There is a lot more people involved in politics than just the president; everyone always seems to forget that. Compared to congress, Obama doesn't have many options. Prism was signed during the Bush Administration and we never went against what they were doing. I apologize for my poor grammar. English is definitely not my first language.

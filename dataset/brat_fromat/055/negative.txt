op_title: I think that Obama has very little to do with the NSA/PRISM Scandal and should not be blamed. CMV

Obama is by no means innocent in this. "Campaign Obama" was very critical of the Bush-era surveillance programs. Even in his 2009 inaugural address, he said "“As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.” Fast forward to today, and not only has he done nothing to roll back these programs, but has greatly expanded them and actively defends them as necessary tools to "protect" us from terrorism etc. 

“I think it’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience”

Although you are correct however that the blame doesn't lay solely with him. 

- All the congress members that voted for all these controversial acts over the years that got us in this mess, they are all guilty as well IMO. 

- The senators like Dianne Feinstein and John McCain who were "in the know" and totally OK with all of this. 

-  The Judges who should have put a stop to this, but allowed everything to continue on in secret.

- The tech/communications companies that bent over backwards to help the government spy on their customers. (Although in all fairness, I don't think they have really had a chance to tell their side of the story yet. I don't think we know at this point exactly how much pressure was put on them by the government to go along with this.)

This is what angers and frustrates me more than anything else, is the fact that **so many** of our representatives and public officials were in on this, and kept secret from the public how far the extent of this program is. In my opinion there are a lot of government employees that *at the very least* should be losing their jobs over this.

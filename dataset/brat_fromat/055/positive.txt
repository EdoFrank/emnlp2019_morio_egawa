op_title: I think that Obama has very little to do with the NSA/PRISM Scandal and should not be blamed. CMV

Sure, others might have been involved. Hell, the entire PRISM system might have already been 100% in place when he came to power. There are others responsible for sure, but that is no reason to excuse Obama. The guy campaigned on privacy and civil/constitutional rights issues. He was elected in a wave of outrage against violations under Bush. Now he has the power to stop an egregious violation of said rights and is choosing to defend the violation instead. in doing so, he's a hypocrite, a liar and a traitor to democracy and American ideals.

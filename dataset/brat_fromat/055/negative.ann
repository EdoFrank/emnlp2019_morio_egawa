T5	Value 793 859	you are correct however that the blame doesn't lay solely with him
T6	Value 865 1006	All the congress members that voted for all these controversial acts over the years that got us in this mess, they are all guilty as well IMO
T7	Value 1012 1117	The senators like Dianne Feinstein and John McCain who were "in the know" and totally OK with all of this
T8	Value 1124 1218	The Judges who should have put a stop to this, but allowed everything to continue on in secret

T10	Value 1356 1435	I don't think they have really had a chance to tell their side of the story yet
T11	Value 1437 1554	I don't think we know at this point exactly how much pressure was put on them by the government to go along with this
T12	Value 1558 1780	This is what angers and frustrates me more than anything else, is the fact that **so many** of our representatives and public officials were in on this, and kept secret from the public how far the extent of this program is

It's kind of hard to get an unbiased "good", as that term is subjective in itself, but I can certainly give you some things.

1. [Signed the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, giving the FDA the authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco for the first time](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h1256enr.txt.pdf)

2. [Signed New START Treaty - nuclear arms reduction pact with Russia](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/world/europe/09prexy.html?_r=1)

3. [First president to endorse same-sex marriage equality](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/05/09/gIQAivsWDU_story.html?hpid=z1) (Although I admit this one is very politicized, so feel free to ignore it if you don't feel it is good to you personally).

4. [Signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, restoring basic protections against pay discrimination for women and other workers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilly_Ledbetter_Fair_Pay_Act_of_2009)

5. [Reversed the policy of barring media coverage during the return of fallen soldiers to Dover Air Force Base](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7986203.stm)

6. [Launched recovery.gov to track spending from the Recovery Act, providing transparency and allowing the public to report fraud, waste, or abuse](http://recovery.gov)

7. [Provided the Department of Veterans Affairs with more than $1.4 billion to improve services to America's Veterans](http://www4.va.gov/budget/products.asp)

8. [Signed the Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act, which provides health care to 11 million kids -- 4 million of whom were previously uninsured](http://themiddleclass.org/bill/children039s-health-insurance-program-reauthorization-act-2009)

9. [Developed stimulus package, which includes approx. $18 billion for nondefense scientific research and development](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/science/18sfstimulus.html)

10. [Signed the Weapons Systems Acquisition Reform Act to stop fraud and wasteful spending in the defense procurement and contracting system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_Systems_Acquisition_Reform_Act_of_2009)

11. [Issued executive order to close the prison at Guantanamo Bay](http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/22/guantanamo.order/index.html) (Didn't work, but that's more Congress's fault, and he's still done more with it than any other President).

12. [Tax cuts for up to 3.5 million small businesses to help pay for employee health care coverage](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/30/obama-signs-bill-on-student-loans-health-care/)

That's all I got for now. You may not think some of these are "good" for you personally, but I think the position that he's done absolutely nothing good is indefensible, considering all that he has done in office, the above being only a small sampling of it.

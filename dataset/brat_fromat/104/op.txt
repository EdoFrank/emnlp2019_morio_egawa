I think that the president hasn't made any good decisions since he took office. I think he is the scum of America, downright Yelawolf style crook. If you can give me examples of some good things that he has done, that would suffice, I mean it's good to have an open mind and I don't want to seem purposefully ignorant. I'm surrounded by people who share the same ideals as I do, if you get what I mean. Can you name like 5 things he did well in?  

I live in New Jersey and I am 17 years old, I wish to gain an unbiased and factual answer for this.  Thank you.

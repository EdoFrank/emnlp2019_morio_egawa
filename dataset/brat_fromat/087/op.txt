By "single use restroom" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time. I don't know if these are common all over the world but they are very common in the United States

Now, I understand the advantages of a single use restroom. They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user. However, at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice. The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex, but this doesn't apply to single use restrooms since the occupant is alone anyway.

What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men? That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available. Unfortunately for them, the other restroom is only for men, so they're just going to have to hold it.

This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary. It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see. That said, I've already had /r/changemyview flip my opinion several times when I really wasn't expecting it to. Maybe there are some points I haven't considered.

T1	Major_Claim 20 99	I don't see any reason why single use restrooms should be gender oriented. CMV.
T2	Value 101 211	By "single use restroom" I mean a public restroom with a lockable door that allows only one occupant at a time
T3	Value 213 264	I don't know if these are common all over the world
T4	Value 269 310	they are very common in the United States
T5	Value 317 369	I understand the advantages of a single use restroom
T6	Value 371 452	They take up less space, are cheaper to build, and offer more privacy to the user
T7	Value 463 592	at least in the US, there are often two of them, one for men and one for women, and I really don't see the point of this practice
T8	Value 594 740	The most convincing argument I've read against unisex restrooms is that some people are uncomfortable urinating/defecating around the opposite sex
T9	Value 746 788	this doesn't apply to single use restrooms
T10	Value 795 823	the occupant is alone anyway
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 826 901	What if there are five women in line for a single use restroom, but no men?
T12	Value 902 986	That line of women could be moving twice as fast if they had two restrooms available
T13	Value 1012 1046	the other restroom is only for men
T14	Value 1051 1088	they're just going to have to hold it
T15	Value 1091 1139	This restriction strikes me as totally arbitrary
T16	Value 1141 1206	It has an obvious downside with no notable upsides that I can see

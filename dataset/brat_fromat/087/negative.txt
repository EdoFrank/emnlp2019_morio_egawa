Stop trying to obsessively advocate for equality in gender specific situations.

1. **Function** Men and women are anatomically different.  Women bathrooms have the necessary equipment to support the female anatomy, and male bathrooms have the necessary equipment (urinals) to support the male anatomy.  

2. **Predation** It is overwhelmingly more likely for pedophiles to be the opposite gender as their victims than it is for them to be the same gender.  Integrating public bathrooms makes it easier for child predators to prey on children.  

3. **Privacy**  One of the key elements of a bathroom is that it offers privacy.  OP, would you support integrated locker rooms in public schools?  Do you think that this would do more harm or good?

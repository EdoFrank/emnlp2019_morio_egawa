op_title: I think Dark Souls is the best game ever made and I cant really enjoy any other new games. Please CMV

Have you've ever read a book, or a series of books (like Harry Potter or ASOIAF) and felt depressed when you finished it? When that happens to me, I look on my bookshelf and pick something completely different from what I just read because I know that anything similar wouldn't be enjoyable (such as reading Harry Potter after ASOIAF would be too similar to each other - both are fantasy after all - but rereading Ender's Game wouldn't be too bad). 

Essentially, you need a rebound game. Something so completely different from Dark Souls that after playing it for a few days and weeks you'll be ready to dive into skyrim or bioshock again, and really enjoy it too!

For me, the best games would be Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, or Surgery Simulator 2013. The last two are so silly that they take the depressing pain away.

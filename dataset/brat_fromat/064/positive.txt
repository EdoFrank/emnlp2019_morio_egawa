Have you looked into roguelikes? Like Brogue, DoomRL, Dungeon Stone Soup, Cataclysm, Dwarf Fortress. Dark Souls design is in part inspired by roguelikes, which also impart a sort deep tension and thrill from the high stakes permadeath. 

You may also consider that Dark Souls works under a different design philosophy than some other games, that they may seem childish because DS is all about challenge (and the beauty/experience of that), whereas other games will focus more about experience and interaction and just factor difficulty into that. Like for example, one of the most memorable moments in Fallout 3 is first exiting your tiny vault into the real world and your eyes have to adjust to the sunlight for the first time. It's like the game just drops you off into this massive world and is letting you know their is so much to explore and it's further reinforced by how tiny and restricted the vault seemed beforehand. The thrill of that has very little to do with challenge, but is trying to excite you with the concept of interaction instead. So to enjoy different games, you may have to come in with different expectations. Dark Souls is a masterpiece of game design, but is working under a different strategy to excite you than something like Bioshock Infinite, which is more genius in it's commentary on game choice and environment as opposed to difficulty.

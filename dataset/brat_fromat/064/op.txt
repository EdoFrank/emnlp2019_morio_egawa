op_title: I think Dark Souls is the best game ever made and I cant really enjoy any other new games. Please CMV

The title says it all, and I understand its rather specific. To me, Dark Souls has the perfect amount of challenge blended with in-depth character development in the most beautiful video game world Ive ever seen. The game doesn't necessarily have the best graphics possible, but the seamless design of the world and the gorgeous views make me say "wow" much more than a game like skyrim, farcry 3, bioshock infinite, or last of us does. Since Ive gotten into dark souls I havent been able to really enjoy any
 other RPG/ adventure games because they simply seem inadequate and childish in comparison to DS. This CMV applies more to new games than old ones, because I certainly still love the games I used to love such as Morrowind, Metroid Prime,  Soul Calibur,  etc.  But dark souls made feel that new games have nothing innovative or redeemable in them. All FPS games seem pretty much the same to me with slight variations, and RPGs seem to just be getting more mainstream and accessible. I would like to get rid of this prejudice, because I really enjoy playing video games, I just haven't found a game I genuinely thought was a masterpiece since I've played dark souls. So please, CMV and maybe suggest some titles you think Id enjoy

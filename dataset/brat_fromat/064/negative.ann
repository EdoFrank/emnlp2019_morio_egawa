T1	Rhetorical_Statement 123 244	Have you've ever read a book, or a series of books (like Harry Potter or ASOIAF) and felt depressed when you finished it?
T2	Testimony 245 354	When that happens to me, I look on my bookshelf and pick something completely different from what I just read
T3	Value 375 413	anything similar wouldn't be enjoyable
T4	Value 423 569	reading Harry Potter after ASOIAF would be too similar to each other - both are fantasy after all - but rereading Ender's Game wouldn't be too bad
T5	Policy 587 610	you need a rebound game
T6	Value 612 787	Something so completely different from Dark Souls that after playing it for a few days and weeks you'll be ready to dive into skyrim or bioshock again, and really enjoy it too
T7	Value 798 876	the best games would be Civ 5, Kerbal Space Program, or Surgery Simulator 2013
T8	Value 878 943	The last two are so silly that they take the depressing pain away

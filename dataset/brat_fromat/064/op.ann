T1	Major_Claim 20 121	I think Dark Souls is the best game ever made and I cant really enjoy any other new games. Please CMV
T2	Value 191 334	Dark Souls has the perfect amount of challenge blended with in-depth character development in the most beautiful video game world Ive ever seen
T3	Value 336 396	The game doesn't necessarily have the best graphics possible
T4	Value 402 558	the seamless design of the world and the gorgeous views make me say "wow" much more than a game like skyrim, farcry 3, bioshock infinite, or last of us does
T5	Testimony 560 631	Since Ive gotten into dark souls I havent been able to really enjoy any
T6	Value 668 728	they simply seem inadequate and childish in comparison to DS
T7	Value 730 778	This CMV applies more to new games than old ones
T8	Testimony 788 889	I certainly still love the games I used to love such as Morrowind, Metroid Prime,  Soul Calibur,  etc
T9	Value 896 977	dark souls made feel that new games have nothing innovative or redeemable in them
T10	Value 979 1112	All FPS games seem pretty much the same to me with slight variations, and RPGs seem to just be getting more mainstream and accessible
T11	Testimony 1201 1295	I just haven't found a game I genuinely thought was a masterpiece since I've played dark souls

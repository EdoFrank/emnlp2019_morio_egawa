T1	Rhetorical_Statement 123 155	Have you looked into roguelikes?
T2	Value 224 357	Dark Souls design is in part inspired by roguelikes, which also impart a sort deep tension and thrill from the high stakes permadeath
T3	Value 361 491	You may also consider that Dark Souls works under a different design philosophy than some other games, that they may seem childish
T4	Value 500 561	DS is all about challenge (and the beauty/experience of that)
T5	Value 571 668	other games will focus more about experience and interaction and just factor difficulty into that
T6	Value 688 851	one of the most memorable moments in Fallout 3 is first exiting your tiny vault into the real world and your eyes have to adjust to the sunlight for the first time
T7	Value 853 1049	It's like the game just drops you off into this massive world and is letting you know their is so much to explore and it's further reinforced by how tiny and restricted the vault seemed beforehand
T8	Value 1051 1175	The thrill of that has very little to do with challenge, but is trying to excite you with the concept of interaction instead
T9	Value 1180 1257	to enjoy different games, you may have to come in with different expectations
T10	Value 1259 1493	Dark Souls is a masterpiece of game design, but is working under a different strategy to excite you than something like Bioshock Infinite, which is more genius in it's commentary on game choice and environment as opposed to difficulty

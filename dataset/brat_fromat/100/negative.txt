Of course the nazi's behaviour is a display of human natural behaviour as they were, in fact, human. Anything done by humans is human nature. 
Which is to say, humanity's nature is to be extremely plastic. It can be capable of horrifying violence or extremely pacifistic. It can be capable of incredible destruction to a scale not seen by any other living organism in the same way it can choose to be protective of other beings that would have no chance of survival without it's presence. 
Saying that humans are by defintion brutal, just because of this, is quite shortsighted.

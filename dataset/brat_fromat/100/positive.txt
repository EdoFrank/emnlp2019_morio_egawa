op_title: CMV - I believe that the crimes committed by the Nazis, even though they were terrible, are a display of human nature

I have thought **a lot** about this topic. 

I live in germany, so by default I have been confronted with the topic in school many times. History was my strongest class. I then studied social sciences and after graduating have been studying a lot of neuroscientific literature and studies. 

Humans are not brutal by nature, we are very complex beings. Our brains are incredibly adaptive to our surroundings and experiences and *most* of all to our culture. 
The crimes commited in the concentration camps were commited under circumstances specifally designed to make them possible. Even the genocide in ruanda (which seems a lot more "spontaneous" on first glance) had very complex historical backgrounds and was incited very deliberately. 

I would argue the contrary: Humans are benevolent and social creatures, that are very capable of violence. 

Think about it. You are less likely to die of violence today, than ever before, why? Because we built our societies in ways that prevent violence more and more. Are we having setbacks? Of course! 

Thousands of years ago, we had to use a lot more violence to survive. Hunt animals down and kill them, defend them against other humans (not brutal humans, *hungry* humans). But we always made our best efforts, to make everything safer and safer. We rebuilt and tried to make it better. And can you argue against the fact, that we have the most comfortable live (on average) today, than any generation before us? Why? Because we are brutal and uncivilzed? That does not make sense.

op_title: CMV - I believe that the crimes committed by the Nazis, even though they were terrible, are a display of human nature

First off I do not in any way think that the crimes were OK or justifiable in any way. 

What I do think though is that crimes like these are a perfect display of the human nature in it's most basic state. IMO it is natural for humans to be brutal and "barbaric". And that human kind as a total will probably never (or at least not in a long time) stray from the path of violence and brutality to a path of kindness and fairness because it is just a natural trait of humans to be brutal.

Good examples to this are actually all the wars that have ever been fought. Sure sometimes you have to stand up against something but still a lot of situations could just be solved without using force or without starting a war yet humanity continues to choose force and war over peace and diplomacy. 

EDIT: I think I have messed up my formulation a bit. What I meant to say is following: A lot of people view what the Nazis did pre as well as during WW2 as inhuman and atrocious. I think that even if they are horrible things they are normal and give a good view of how humans as a species are.

Or in other words humans are by definition and nature brutal and tend to be so.

(Sorry somehow my English skills are just giving up on me -.-)

**EDIT 2 (10.10.13 / 19:20 GMT+1):** I will take a look at your posts when I am back on my computer. To say it some things did make me start to rethink my views. 

Thanks for your replies so far :)

op_title: I believe scientific reasoning is the best way to collectively know reality, understand the natural world, and gain empirical knowledge.

Disclaimer: I generally agree with OP but am playing devil's advocate.

The problem with this is that there is an (mostly Western) expectation of education and an underlying tone of progressionism. 

While there are some people who instinctively follow a "scientific model" throughout their life - hypothesis, testing, learning from experience - I would argue that the rate of people who do this is much higher among educated and Westernized people than, say, a farmer in Africa who did not have a chance at an education. 

Additionally, this idea promotes the concept that you are moving forward by gathering information. However, what about knowledge that cannot be gathered through empiricism? We shouldn't all have to become meth addicts, or know/observe meth addicts to how bad the drug can be to us. Can we not learn through parable? What if this information/experiment is more damaging to you than beneficial? What about your own subjective view that coats the whole experience?

I'm going to go all Buddhist on you here and argue that the best way to know reality is to know yourself - through meditation, knowing your body, and self-analysis of any kind. By knowing yourself, you can remove yourself as much as possible from the equation of life (view your experiences with the knowledge that you feel X way because you are Y or feel Z) and have a more genuine, truthful view - that's reality: no self.

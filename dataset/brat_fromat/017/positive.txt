[Here](http://books.google.com/books?id=8y-FVtrKeSYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=paul+feyerabend+against+method&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2BB6Ud2cCIrM9QSrxIGoBA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) is a link to Paul Feyerabend's *Against Method* in which he argues against the current model of the scientific method. I suggest starting on page 9 as it is most pertinent to what you're talking about. 

To summarize for the lazy/don't have time:

Feyerabend argues that the scientific methodology is too constrictive to the pursuit of knowledge. Many great discoveries have been by accident or have ignored the scientific method to reach a goal. Additionally, you fail to realize that science is not merely a tool, but instead is influenced by human biases and expectations. Science education, for example, is taught outside the context of history (mostly, some teachers will throw in the context) and  philosophy (i.e. metaphysics). Epistemology isn't taught when pursuing a science degree in the university unless the student branches out. And as [u/pezz29](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d1i55/i_believe_scientific_reasoning_is_the_best_way_to/c9lz82w) points out, how can you really know what you know if you don't understand what knowledge is? 

The scientific method is the best way of attaining knowledge we've got right now. But the same can be said about religion in the past, and look how ~~reddit~~ ~~scientists~~ some people view religion.

TLDR: The scientific method is constrictive and doesn't account for many factors in its pursuit of knowledge or in how we educate, as well as other stuff i didn't go into.

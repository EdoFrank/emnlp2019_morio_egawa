T1	Value 145 337	the problem with this is that while it makes a certain sort of sense, history shows that it would be applied for bad purposes and that the solution proposed causes more problems than it solves
T2	Value 340 478	This isn't speculation, but rather the only conclusion that can be drawn from the USA's prior history of judicially mandated sterilization
T3	Fact 481 670	One of the stated purposes [1] of the program was to prevent harm to children by rendering sterile those people who had demonstrated themselves to be abusive or neglectful to their children
T4	Fact 687 973	what happened was that the program was used to sterilize as many poor white people and black people as the law could manage (even when there was no evidence of abuse or neglect), and that rich white people were simply not forcibly sterilized even when abundant evidence of abuse existed
T5	Value 976 1067	I don't at all like the idea of people with a past history of neglect and abuse having kids
T6	Testimony 1107 1464	I've got relatives who are abusive and neglectful towards their children (CPS has taken them away, and quite rightly so) and they keep having more children (which CPS can't take away until they manage to gather evidence of abuse and/or neglect, so the newborn has a month or three living with horrible people before CPS can do it's job and get the kids out)
T7	Value 1467 1624	If there were ever candidates for forcible sterilization, I know two personally and agree 100% that in a perfect world they would not be allowed to reproduce
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 1647 1679	we don't live in a perfect world
T9	Fact 1682 1816	We live in a nation where the courts and police can be statistically shown to police minority groups more heavily than majority groups
T10	Fact 1822 1922	we live in a world where the courts give longer sentences to minority groups than to majority groups
T11	Value 1939 2263	the courts have a statistically demonstrable tendency to simply not charge rich people, and on the rare occasion rich people do get into legal trouble they get lighter sentences than poor people (if for no other reason than that rich people can afford really great lawyers, while poor people get overworked public defenders)
T12	Fact 2275 2404	we have historic evidence that the last time it was tried, mandatory sterilization was directed mainly against the poor and black
T13	Value 2442 2583	the social problems caused by legally mandating sterilization are going to outweigh the benefits of having fewer children abused or neglected
T14	Value 2586 2603	I don't like that
T15	Value 2606 2661	I honestly wish I could support mandatory sterilization
T16	Testimony 2670 2752	I've seen firsthand what happens when people unfit for parenthood keep having kids
T17	Value 2779 2911	the better solution is reality based, age appropriate, sex ed in schools, starting at kindergarten and continuing through graduation
T18	Rhetorical_Statement 2918 2953	easily available free contraception
T19	Value 2964 3085	the truth is that most of the people who are having kids they abuse and neglect don't really want kids in the first place
T20	Value 3117 3280	in nations where sex ed is better, and contraception is more affordable or paid for by the government, the rate of child abuse and neglect is lower than in the USA
T21	Fact 3309 3412	another of the big stated purposes of the America's foray into court ordered sterilization was eugenics
T22	Fact 3428 3635	the majority of people arrested for possession of marijuana are black, despite the fact that every study done to date has shown that black people use marijuana at a significantly lower rate than white people
T23	Value 3638 3807	All things being equal, you'd expect the majority of arrests for possession of marijuana to be white (not only are whites the majority, but they use pot more frequently)
T24	Fact 3814 3869	black people get arrested for it more than white people
T25	Fact 3939 4042	Black people get sentences about 60% longer, on average, than white people who committed the same crime

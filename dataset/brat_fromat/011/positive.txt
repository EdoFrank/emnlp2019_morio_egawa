op_title: I think sterilization should be an optional punishment for those found guilty of child negligence/abuse. CMV

I understand how horrible child abuse is. There are many thing which are horrible. However, we should not permanently punish people for mistakes they made in the past.  Maybe if we could sterilize them for ten years or so that I see works. Tails comes from a person who made a mistake or two and was busted, now I find it exteremly difficult to find work.  I find it hard to find work at pizza hut, I just finished my chemistry degree and no one will take me do to two felonies...

op_title: I don't think breakfast is all that important, or necessary. CMV

For many years, I've regularly skipped breakfast. It's sort of an established habit by now, I picked it up in school when I would be in a rush in the mornings, and it's gradually evolved to the point where I regularly skip breakfast, often skip lunch, and just eat a slightly larger dinner, or a separate dinner and supper. During Ramadan, when people fast until sundown? I do that almost every day, with no apparent ill effects.

I know this is supposed to be unhealthy, but I don't have any concrete reasons as to *why*. People label breakfast as the most important meal of the day, but I don't know why. Over time, it's become something of a hindrance to me. It's just such a hassle in the morning to try and throw together some sort of food when I'm trying to get ready for the day. For a long time, I'd simply forget to eat, I wouldn't feel hungry until later in the day.

I know this is supposed to be bad for me, and I'd really appreciate it if someone could provide me with some concrete reasons as to *why,* so I can convince myself that it's important to eat normally.

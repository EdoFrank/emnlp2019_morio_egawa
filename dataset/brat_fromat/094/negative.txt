op_title: I don't think breakfast is all that important, or necessary. CMV

Breakfast is important because it is the first meal you eat after sleeping for considerable amount of time. During this time, you are fasting, and there is no need for your body to metabolise food. However, if you fail to eat when you wake up, your body gets into the habit of needing to conserve your energy for even longer than the 8 or so hours. This means your metabolism slows down, and if you eat the same amount of food as someone else that spreads it out throughout the day, you are far more likely to put on weight, as your body tries to conserve every portion of food you have, as it cant work out when it will next get a feed.Another drawback of this slowed metabolism is that as energy is needed to be conserved, this energy can't be used to think at work/school, or just generally be energetic about your day. Of course, everyone is different and you seem to have a pretty decent metabolism if you are still at a healthy weight etc. Just keep in mind that eating breakfast may increase your ability to concentrate, even if you think you are doing ok right now (:

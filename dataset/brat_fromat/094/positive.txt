There are a number of reasons that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

1. Eating first thing in the morning stabilizes blood sugar levels, which regulate appetite and energy.
1. Breakfast is thought to play an important role in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
1. Breakfast can be a good source of vitamins. A simple meal of processed cereals can provide vitamins and minerals which people can find it difficult to get elsewhere with just two meals a day.

Now, this doesn't mean that a breakfast of pancakes and bacon every day is going to be healthy, but there are a ton of easy recipes that you can make to get your day started off well.

* A whole grain bagel with cream cheese
* A bowl of whole grain cereal with milk or yogurt and a side of fruit
* A bowl of oatmeal (I like quaker oats, you just put oats and milk in a bowl and microwave for 2 minutes, add a bit of cinnamon)
* A fruit smoothie or breakfast smoothie (http://www.marthastewart.com/341010/banana-oat-smoothie)

If you're in a time crunch you could just have a protein shake or an apple or something easy like that. It's all about getting in the habit, just takes a week or two of being disciplined before it starts to feel natural.

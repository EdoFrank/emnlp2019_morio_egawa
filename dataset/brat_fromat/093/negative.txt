op_title: People who won't admit to their racism are the worst kind of racists. CMV

It almost sounds like you wish the word racism ended all arguments. The fact is that people will disagree over what constitutes racism in some cases, and when they're called out for being racist, will naturally defend themselves and deny being racist. Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word "racist"? It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away.

Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said "this is what I'm talking about right here, guys" without explaining why it's racist. And I think the argument could be made, but you seem more interested in shaming the guy.

This is what I really dislike about much far-left discourse: whoever is objecting to something is automatically in the right. But it doesn't work like that. It *is* possible to take offense too easily, and some accusations of racism *are* ridiculous. I've seen people accused of racism for simply bringing up what race someone was, in a context in which the person's race was relevant. Should people never deny being racist, even in cases like that? If there is any disagreement over what's racist--which is only natural--people who defend themselves will inevitably commit the infraction you dislike so strongly.

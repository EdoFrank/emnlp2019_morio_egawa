op_title: People who won't admit to their racism are the worst kind of racists. CMV

I believe that racism is fundamentally a product of ignorance.

I'm gonna borrow /u/nope_nic_tesla example from here:http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1mq464/people_who_wont_admit_to_their_racism_are_the/ccbk1g7

&gt;I think OP is talking about people who might say something like, "Black people are savages. Look at their rate of violence compared to white people. This isn't racist, it's just a fact.

We need to carefully deconstruct this hypothetical. The hypothetical fact here is rates of violence in black populated areas is higher than white populated areas. The actual racism occurs when someone goes from that fact to the *conclusion* that "black people are [*inherently*]" savages because they are ignorant of all the external forces in between.

Racism is not a simple thing. It is complex and easily conflated with all sorts of other things. The fundamental point that combats racism is that there are no inherent superiorities or inferiorities due to race and that any admittedly factual discrepancies in rates of violence or what have you are *not* inherent and are actually due to external factors like socio-economic forces.

&gt;People who talk about living in a "post-racial" society are basically part of this group.

People who conceive of a post-racial society are not wrong at the level of their idealism. When I think post-racial I think a society that does not hold any beliefs that race inherently creates superiority or inferiority. This is not a racist ideal to hold fundamentally, but it does leave room for ignorance and mistaken logic.

The problem is when someone assumes that the ideal has already been reached when it has not, because then they are blind to *actual* racism and might end up committing racism.

So are people who believe the world is post-racial or point to factual discrepancies between race are not *wholly* ignorant. What they are ignorant of in the former case is that the world is not yet free of racism, and in the latter case that factual discrepancies that are *correlated* with race are not *caused* by race.

So are people who are ignorant in aspects of their view *worse* racists than people who are *wholly* ignorant of the fact that race should not be held as an inherent aspect of causation? I don't know that they are worse, they are just mistaken/ignorant in different ways. 

I think that there is a sliding scale of ignorance that parallels the sliding scale scale of racism, and it can be hard to determine where a specific view or particular person falls on these scales. 

You can not be ignorant of some things, but be ignorant of other and still be "racist", but there are also racists who are even *more* ignorant that still have a lot of learning and empathy to experience before they cross the threshold of racist beliefs. 

Some ability for rational thought is better than no ability for rational thought upon which to fight racist cognitive structures.

I totally see your point of view though, but hopefully some of this helps change your view!

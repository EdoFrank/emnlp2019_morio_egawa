T1	Major_Claim 20 93	People who won't admit to their racism are the worst kind of racists. CMV
T2	Value 103 324	one of the worst and most insidious types of racists are people who deny that something they've said or done is racist or, worse still, complain about being forced to use "P.C." (or, as most us know it, "polite") language
T3	Value 327 707	Not only are they showing an aggressive aversion to ever bettering themselves or acknowledging any unconscious racial prejudices and hatred they might have, they actually do more to normalize racist rhetoric and discrimination that people who freely admit to their racism or the "dog-whistle" crowd who don't complain about black people, just "Welfare queens" and "urban violence"
T4	Value 709 782	Everyone knows what that means and they aren't getting away with anything
T5	Value 792 934	the people who act like talking about racism is somehow more racist than whatever racist statement of theirs they're being asked to talk about
T6	Value 937 955	They are the worst
T7	Value 958 1076	As in, actual worst, and perhaps the greatest threat to the integrity and cohesion of a multiethnic society imaginable
T8	Value 1079 1118	I don't believe in criminalizing speech
T9	Value 1124 1186	we need to accept as a society that that shit is over the line
T10	Value 1189 1245	This type of racism tends to be *very* popular on Reddit
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1250 1299	I really look forward to some exciting responses!
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1301 1334	while keeping it civil, of course
T13	Value 1352 1515	I'd like to hear anyone who's objected when they were told something they said or did was racist explain why it wasn't/at least wasn't egregious or was in good fun
T14	Value 1523 1657	People who talk about living in a "post-racial" society are basically part of this group, if that helps clarify what I'm talking about
T15	Value 1660 1943	The best example I can think of is someone saying that a Chinese food delivery "take too wrong" or that a particular neighborhood or building that's not actually run down is "ghetto" because it's mostly black and then getting angry when they're told that's a super racist thing to do
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 2412 2431	Yeah, bro, it does!
T17	Value 2433 2468	Talking about people like that here

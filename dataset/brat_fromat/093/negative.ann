T1	Value 95 161	It almost sounds like you wish the word racism ended all arguments
T2	Value 180 345	people will disagree over what constitutes racism in some cases, and when they're called out for being racist, will naturally defend themselves and deny being racist
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 347 446	Do you honestly expect people to just stop what they're doing whenever they hear the word "racist"?
T4	Value 447 632	It's much more helpful to have a conversation about why you think it's racist (which admittedly can be hard, because people get defensive about it) than to just cry racism and walk away
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 635 843	Case in point: someone in this thread disagreed that making fun of accents was racist, and you just called him out and said "this is what I'm talking about right here, guys" without explaining why it's racist
T6	Value 857 883	the argument could be made
T7	Value 889 932	you seem more interested in shaming the guy
T8	Value 935 1059	This is what I really dislike about much far-left discourse: whoever is objecting to something is automatically in the right
T9	Value 1065 1090	it doesn't work like that
T10	Value 1092 1184	It *is* possible to take offense too easily, and some accusations of racism *are* ridiculous
T11	Testimony 1186 1319	I've seen people accused of racism for simply bringing up what race someone was, in a context in which the person's race was relevant
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1321 1384	Should people never deny being racist, even in cases like that?
T13	Value 1385 1547	If there is any disagreement over what's racist--which is only natural--people who defend themselves will inevitably commit the infraction you dislike so strongly

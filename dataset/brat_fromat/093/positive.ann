T1	Value 110 156	racism is fundamentally a product of ignorance
T2	Value 511 561	We need to carefully deconstruct this hypothetical
T3	Value 563 672	The hypothetical fact here is rates of violence in black populated areas is higher than white populated areas
T4	Value 674 862	The actual racism occurs when someone goes from that fact to the *conclusion* that "black people are [*inherently*]" savages because they are ignorant of all the external forces in between
T5	Value 865 893	Racism is not a simple thing
T6	Value 895 960	It is complex and easily conflated with all sorts of other things
T7	Value 962 1247	The fundamental point that combats racism is that there are no inherent superiorities or inferiorities due to race and that any admittedly factual discrepancies in rates of violence or what have you are *not* inherent and are actually due to external factors like socio-economic forces
T8	Value 1345 1434	People who conceive of a post-racial society are not wrong at the level of their idealism
T9	Value 1436 1565	When I think post-racial I think a society that does not hold any beliefs that race inherently creates superiority or inferiority
T10	Value 1567 1615	This is not a racist ideal to hold fundamentally
T11	Value 1621 1672	it does leave room for ignorance and mistaken logic
T12	Value 1675 1766	The problem is when someone assumes that the ideal has already been reached when it has not
T13	Value 1781 1849	they are blind to *actual* racism and might end up committing racism
T14	Value 1855 1975	are people who believe the world is post-racial or point to factual discrepancies between race are not *wholly* ignorant
T15	Value 1977 2173	What they are ignorant of in the former case is that the world is not yet free of racism, and in the latter case that factual discrepancies that are *correlated* with race are not *caused* by race
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 2179 2362	are people who are ignorant in aspects of their view *worse* racists than people who are *wholly* ignorant of the fact that race should not be held as an inherent aspect of causation?
T17	Value 2363 2446	I don't know that they are worse, they are just mistaken/ignorant in different ways
T18	Value 2463 2647	there is a sliding scale of ignorance that parallels the sliding scale scale of racism, and it can be hard to determine where a specific view or particular person falls on these scales
T19	Value 2651 2737	You can not be ignorant of some things, but be ignorant of other and still be "racist"
T20	Value 2743 2904	there are also racists who are even *more* ignorant that still have a lot of learning and empathy to experience before they cross the threshold of racist beliefs
T21	Value 2908 3036	Some ability for rational thought is better than no ability for rational thought upon which to fight racist cognitive structures

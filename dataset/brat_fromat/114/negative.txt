I fail to see the logic or even perspective of this argument. Everyone is allowed their opinion.  What matters is how people *act* on that opinion.

Group A both vocalizes and takes action to prevent Group B's rights - rights which affect Group A *in no way whatsoever*.

When people tell Group A to shut the hell up and leave Group B alone to live their own lives, you call this a "witch hunt"?  What do you call it when Group A vocalizes hatred toward and tries to limit the rights of Group B?

I would really like someone to explain the "Don't discriminate against my discrimination!" line of thinking to me some time in some way that doesn't sound like nothing but absolute crazy-person babble.

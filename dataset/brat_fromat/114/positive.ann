T1	Value 77 114	I don't necessarily disagree with you
T2	Value 119 356	I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone
T3	Value 364 428	homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human
T4	Value 430 479	many people consider them fair game to disrespect
T5	Value 481 558	Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others
T6	Value 568 667	this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational
T7	Testimony 669 685	I am an American
T8	Value 691 772	we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there
T9	Value 774 941	You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords
T10	Value 953 1062	the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms
T11	Value 1064 1114	This is not the exact same thing but it is similar
T12	Value 1116 1293	Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't
T13	Value 1296 1568	The part that doesn't convince me is that it assumes that respect is some limited thing that cannot be given out to everyone (as opposed to freedom which clearly can't), whereas I believe that it is possible to respect people who have radically different beliefs than I do
T14	Value 1587 1622	I do not respect all people equally
T15	Value 1624 1778	I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard
T16	Value 1780 1839	This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person
T17	Value 1841 1971	I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few
T18	Value 1973 2102	When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well
T19	Value 2104 2141	Homophobes are terribly closed-minded
T20	Value 2143 2267	I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way
T21	Value 2269 2306	It is definitely a knock against them
T22	Value 2308 2480	I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone
T23	Value 2482 2594	I do not respect them enough to take most of their opinions seriously, at least on the topic of society and laws
T24	Value 2597 2667	With regards to the "witch-hunt" I am actually not very bothered by it
T25	Value 2669 2784	I strongly believe that gay people should have equal rights, and a large and growing number of people agree with me
T26	Value 2786 2928	There are still many people who don't but it is becoming increasingly more difficult for them to be open about it, which I see as a good thing
T27	Value 2930 2990	The message being sent is that it is not ok to be homophobic
T28	Value 2998 3211	it is not being sent in the nicest of ways as it tells homophobes that their beliefs are not ok (which is always hard to hear and tends to make people defensive as you noted) but it is an important message to send
T29	Value 3216 3263	I would rather it happen poorly than not at all

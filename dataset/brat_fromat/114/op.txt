op_title: Homophobes deserve the same respect as anyone else CMV

To start off with, I support gay people as well as gay marriage. I really don't see the appeal of hooking up with the same sex, but I don't see why I should get in the way of those who do. Gay people are still people, and to treat someone like crap just because they aren't like you is just a down-right dirty thing to do.

Homophobes are people too. I don't agree with what they do or what they believe in, but how does treating them like crap make me any better? I think homophobes are flawed, no doubt, but I think it best to look past a persons flaws and accept the good in them.

I really don't understand this witch hunt people have going on. If you respond to a difference in opinion with a backlash of hate and rage, what benefit does that have? Why would a person want to listen to somebody who treats them badly? Whenever somebody lashes out at me, I feel no need to listen to what they have to say.

On the other hand, if you prove yourself to be a good friend, they just must be willing to hear what you have to say. It's almost like leading by example. I mean, they might think "Wow, even though this guy didn't agree with me, he still treated me nice and was a good friend. Maybe just because I don't like the idea of being gay, doesn't mean gay people are bad". 

And maybe they don't come around. You can still have a friend with which you can agree to disagree. That's still better than making enemies.

op_title: I believe that Marriage as a lifetime commitment is an outdated expectation. CMV

I think that the Till Death Do You Part idea of marriage is simply not supported. Most marriages end in divorce anyway. In my own family, my great grand parents divorced, so did my grandparents and so did my parents. I don't know what should replace the lifetime commitment and expectation of monogamy of Marriage. This is an important question because I want to raise a kid someday. I believe the economic and financial stability of a two parent household is probably best for kids, but I have no interest in monogamy, nor could I ever pretend to believe I will want to be with the same person for my entire life.

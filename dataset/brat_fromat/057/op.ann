T1	Major_Claim 20 96	I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV
T2	Testimony 110 217	I attend a university where all students pay athletic fees in exchange for the use of school gym facilities
T3	Value 246 292	this should be changed to an opt in/out system
T4	Value 293 370	I am more interested in hearing reasons why women's only hours are defensible
T5	Value 372 544	This renders particular pieces of equiptment totally unavailable to male students (as they are only present in specific gyms) for hours during prime times throughout he day
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 549 665	if one is  paying equal fees to all other students why is one not allowed equal access and how is this a good thing?
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 666 702	Doesn't it simply perpetuate sexism?
T8	Testimony 765 828	I am female and have taken advantage of these hours in the past

op_title: I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV

While I agree that this is not ideal (and I don't use the women only area at my gym at all), there are several good reasons that I can see for doing this. 

One is a public health tactic. Women are much less likely than men to get sufficient exercise. Exercise is an important protective behaviour for good health. The presence of men in the gym is a barrier for some women for exercising. So having some times where women can exercise without men present is likely to lead to improved health outcomes.

Another is to provide a space for women whose cultural/religious beliefs mean that they can't effectively exercise in the gym with men present (imagine working out in hijab). In multi-cultural societies, this has a place.

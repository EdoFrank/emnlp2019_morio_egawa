T1	Testimony 98 230	I used to work at an aquatic center that had women's only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool
T2	Testimony 259 380	the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion
T3	Value 382 446	It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times
T4	Value 455 516	they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men
T5	Value 593 635	the women's only hours there may be sexist
T6	Value 641 751	they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours

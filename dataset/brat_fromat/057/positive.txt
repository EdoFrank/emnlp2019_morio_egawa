op_title: I believe that women's only hours at gyms are sexist and shouldn't exist CMV

I used to work at an aquatic center that had women's only hours once a week during which only female lifeguards would cover the pool. As it was explained to me, the primary purpose of these hours was to give Muslim and Orthodox women a place to swim without violating their religion. It was common for non-religious women to swim during these times because they felt more comfortable not having to swim in front of men. 

I don't know what the rationale is at your gym.  I would argue that yes, the women's only hours there may be sexist, but they also allow women to partake in an activity that would otherwise be prohibited to them during normal hours.

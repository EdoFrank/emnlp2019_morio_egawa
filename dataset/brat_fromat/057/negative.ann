T1	Value 104 134	I agree that this is not ideal
T2	Testimony 140 188	I don't use the women only area at my gym at all
T3	Value 191 251	there are several good reasons that I can see for doing this
T4	Value 255 284	One is a public health tactic

T6	Value 350 411	Exercise is an important protective behaviour for good health
T7	Value 413 486	The presence of men in the gym is a barrier for some women for exercising
T8	Value 491 599	having some times where women can exercise without men present is likely to lead to improved health outcomes

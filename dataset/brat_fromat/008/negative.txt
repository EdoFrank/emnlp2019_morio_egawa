op_title: I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV

Wrong or not, here is a friend's (#1) experience with another slutty female friend (#2):

* Friend #2 is slutty, so brings a different date to each event. Requiring friend #1 to constantly interact with new people at parties/events where it is supposed to be close friends only

* Friend #2 is slutty, so sleeps with other male friends of female friend #1, forcing situation where friend #1 must 'Choose sides' and ruined friendship with the guy friend, who she really liked.

* Friend #2 is never available to do things as a 'couple' with friend #1 who is in a committed relationship, because friend #2, is never in a relationship.

* Every evening spent with friend #2 becomes about her dating life. This is normal in female friendships, when one member of a group has a new relationship. But, because friend #2, is *always* in the throes of a new relationship/partner, she manipulates the groups 'new relationship' time. and causes drama. Like the time when she had to use emergency contraceptives. OR the guy turned crazy.

* Going out for a 'girls night' ends up with #2 hooking up with someone, leaving friend #1 to go home early, or be alone.

* Women also often don't trust promiscuous women to be around their own partners. Its why 'slutty' girls only hang out with other 'slutty' girls. And why girls in long term, committed relationships i.e.e 'nice girls', don't enjoy spending time with 'slutty' girls.

So, while I wouldn't argue that its **wrong** (because right and wrong are so vague, anyways), I would say it is socially unacceptable, and that these are some examples of why. I would also like to point out, that I  think it has *nothing* to do with jealousy. I think it is about preserving social structure.

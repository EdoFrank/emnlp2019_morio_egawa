op_title: I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV

A problem is that use of a condom is risk management, it doesn't remove risk. All the risks that are present without condoms are still present with them, just to a lesser extent. So, promiscuity is a potential health hazard, even with safe sex.

Additionally, it's easy to wind up with different goals with sex partners, people who initially wanted no strings attached can wind up unintentionally attached. These things have a nasty tendency to explode socially, which makes them rather disruptive. It might work out just fine the vast majority of the time, but it only requires a couple of situations to end in shouting matches, broken friendships, feuds, or cases of stalking for the community to have a serious problem.

A strong selection process can carefully manage these issues to the point where I would argue that someone could successfully do so an not be socially disruptive or a vector for disease. The problem is this is at loggerheads with the goal of having lots of sex, either one limits sex in one a variety of ways and reaches a balance with society at large or one does not limit sex and does provoke social pressure to do so. 

Guys who do likewise are also looked down upon, largely for the same reason. It's just not as pronounced because of a biased cultural inheritance. So it's not something all that gender specific.

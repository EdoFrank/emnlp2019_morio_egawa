op_title: I don't think it's wrong for a girl to be slutty and promiscuous provided that she practises safe sex and birth control. CMV

I don't see why women that have lots of sex (usually not with the same person) are  looked down upon. Sex is something that all enjoy and that can be simply practiced for pleasure. 

As long as she or her partner use a condom,and she isn't cheating / sleeping with a person already in  a relationship,  I really don't see the problem.

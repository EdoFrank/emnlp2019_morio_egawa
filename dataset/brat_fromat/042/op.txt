When you are in your teens and young adult years in the US, there are plenty of birthday milestones to look forward to.  At 16, you can get a driver's license.  At 17, you can go see R rated films in theatres.  At 18, you are a legal adult and can do many things like buy tobacco, vote, get into some clubs/bars/venues, and at 21 you can buy alcohol.  But what comes next?  I now basically have all the legal and social freedoms that I will ever get, and I cannot think of any particular milestones that I would want to look forward to.  Some might say the age when I am able to retire and collect social security, but who knows what that will be like by the time I actually get to that age?  (I also don't like the social security system, but that's a debate for another day).  I also hope that I make a career for myself that I love enough to not want to retire as soon as I'm able to, so that's another reason why I wouldn't really look forward to that.

So please, change my view!

I'll probably be away from the computer for an hour or so, but I'll be back later to reply to people.

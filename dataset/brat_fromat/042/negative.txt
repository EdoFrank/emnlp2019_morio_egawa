I'm guessing you're American.  Apologies if I'm wrong.  Here's a few specific milestones I can think of.

25 - Pretty much everyone will now rent you a car without making you pay absurd rates.

26 - Significant drop in car insurance premiums, especially if you're a male.

32 - You're age is a power of 2!  You can go around saying that you're 10000 years old!  I am looking forward to this

35 - Minimum age of office for some positions, including president.

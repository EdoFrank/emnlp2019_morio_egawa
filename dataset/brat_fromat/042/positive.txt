A bunch of rental services (cars, vacation venues, etc) require the person making the reservation to be at least 25. After that, the decades are generally considered milestones. 30 is when you're "omg so old". 40 is when you can start being sad about being "old". 50 is when you stop feeling bad about being "old". 65 is retirement. 90 is when people start writing newspaper blurbs about your birthday and you start competing for oldest guy in the city.

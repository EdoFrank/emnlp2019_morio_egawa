op_title: I think most "Modern Art" is pretentious, takes nearly no skill, and is sub-par compared to art before that period. CMV.

I've heard the arguments behind the many paintings under the category of Modern Art. I just don't see how these can be considered "good art". I won't deny that it is art, I just consider them horrible pieces of art.

I don't think all modern art is horrible. Just a lot of it. I'll provide examples:

I feel that the message the "artist" is trying to convey can probably  be sent in a more pleasing image. I feel that "modern art" is just an excuse for untalented artist to create expressions that are lacking in substance without being called out as a bad artist.

Change my view, please. Thank you for your time.

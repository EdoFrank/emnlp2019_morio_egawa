op_title: I think most "Modern Art" is pretentious, takes nearly no skill, and is sub-par compared to art before that period. CMV.

Modern artists I met have the same basic skills as those who paint in a more classic style. They all know how to draw straight lines, how to blend colors correctly, use perspective, etc. If modern art really "[took] no skill", then you'd think everybody would be able to do what they do.

You'd be surprised at how much probably went into making that solid blue work. Imagine how different the impact would be if it were a different shade, or the dimensions of the frame were a bit different. I'm not an artist (I'm a CS student of all people), but even just a minute amount of exposure to the practice behind art will allow you to understand how these paintings work.

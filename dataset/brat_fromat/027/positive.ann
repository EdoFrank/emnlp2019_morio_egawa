T1	Value 206 409	art didn’t get properly started until the 20th century, the stuff that came before it is interesting, but doesn’t have the same understanding of what art is, and usually doesn’t even seem to be trying to
T2	Value 411 545	They seem more interested with trying to directly imitate nature or convey religious ideas than explore or define art for its own sake
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 548 583	I’ll focus on the Mondrian painting
T4	Value 591 657	I consider him to be the most important artist of the 20th century
T5	Value 794 887	If you look at Mondrian’s body of work, his ability to paint realistically is obviously great
T6	Value 893 1025	he wanted to explore what a painting actually *was*, and condense that to its core; to strip away everything that wasn’t *essential*
T7	Value 1027 1081	This is why he used only horizontal and vertical lines
T8	Value 1091 1170	they implied every other possible line and shape, and the three primary colours
T9	Value 1179 1210	they implied every other colour
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 1212 1262	How else would you suggest he convey this message?
T11	Value 1263 1324	His solution seems, to me, brilliant, elegant, and inevitable
T12	Value 1327 1539	Modern art is concerned with “what is art?” and the modern paintings you have shown are concerned with painting as colour on surface, which, to paraphrase Clement Greenberg, is all they are and all they should be
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1541 1675	These concerns fly in direct opposition to your own, which, from your criticisms, seem to be primarily about producing pretty pictures

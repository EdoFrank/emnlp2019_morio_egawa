op_title: I think most "Modern Art" is pretentious, takes nearly no skill, and is sub-par compared to art before that period. CMV.

I have the direct opposite view, so let me weigh in-I feel like art didn’t get properly started until the 20th century, the stuff that came before it is interesting, but doesn’t have the same understanding of what art is, and usually doesn’t even seem to be trying to. They seem more interested with trying to directly imitate nature or convey religious ideas than explore or define art for its own sake.

I’ll focus on the Mondrian painting, since I consider him to be the most important artist of the 20th century. You claim that there would be a better way for these artists to express their ideas, you also claim that they require little/no skill. If you look at Mondrian’s body of work, his ability to paint realistically is obviously great, but he wanted to explore what a painting actually *was*, and condense that to its core; to strip away everything that wasn’t *essential*. This is why he used only horizontal and vertical lines, because they implied every other possible line and shape, and the three primary colours because they implied every other colour. How else would you suggest he convey this message? His solution seems, to me, brilliant, elegant, and inevitable.

Modern art is concerned with “what is art?” and the modern paintings you have shown are concerned with painting as colour on surface, which, to paraphrase Clement Greenberg, is all they are and all they should be. These concerns fly in direct opposition to your own, which, from your criticisms, seem to be primarily about producing pretty pictures.

Schooling system in my country(Slovenia) is almost exactly as you described. Education is free from primary school all the way up to phd. Everything is funded by taxpayers money so basically the only thing you need to pay for are books and pens. While attending university you also get different benefits like tax reduction if you decide to work, coupons for lunch so you don't have to pay the full price for your meal, cheaper monthly tickets for public transport, etc. Schools with tuition do exist. However their courses haven't been tested yet so there is no guarantee you will get a job when you get the degree.

On the other hand such a system has considerable amount of flaws. Many people decide to abuse it for years so they enroll in a university solely for benefits, therefore they don't actually attend classes. Because of the crisis the government can't spend the same amounts of money for education, so they decided to cut teachers salaries. Consequently many of them became overburdened with responsibilities and extremely unhappy with their position, which decreased the quality of education. Many people also study for professions that don't have any demand on the market.

To sum up, free education may seem like a good idea, however it cost a lot of money for the government(ours is almost bankrupt) and decreases the quality of education for everyone.

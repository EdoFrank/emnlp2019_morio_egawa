op_title: I believe that all schools in all stages of education should be free. CMV

Just to be clear, I believe that no one should be **able** to pay for school (except for extra curricular things like excursions).

I believe that the money which goes into schools and universities should come from our taxes and that schools should receive an amount of money depending on the amount of students attending it.

The problem I have with the current system is that wealthier families send their kids to private schools and many poorer families are forced to send their kids to public schools. Whilst public schools can still be good, I don't see why any child should receive a better education than any other child, no matter how much money they have.

If all schools were free to attend then eventually, I predict all schools would become much more equal, meaning that everyone would receive a much more equal education, which could eventually close the gap between rich and poor rather than widen it the way it does now.

I assume this would be incredibly difficult to implement, but could it still work in theory?

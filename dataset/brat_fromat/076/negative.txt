I lived in a country where all education was free.  I was even getting paid a stipend while attending university.  The quality of education was good, and the fact that it was free was a nice touch.

Unfortunately there is no such thing as free lunch.  Somebody still has to pay for it.  The government that paid teachers' salaries took this money from my parents by paying them way less than free market would (most jobs were controlled by the government, so the government set salaries).  The government also was notoriously inefficient, wasting money and resources.

So I would rather pay for education directly rather than pay the government and let it pay for the education.

T1	Major_Claim 20 93	I believe that all schools in all stages of education should be free. CMV
T2	Value 128 224	no one should be **able** to pay for school (except for extra curricular things like excursions)
T3	Value 242 419	the money which goes into schools and universities should come from our taxes and that schools should receive an amount of money depending on the amount of students attending it
T4	Value 422 599	The problem I have with the current system is that wealthier families send their kids to private schools and many poorer families are forced to send their kids to public schools
T5	Value 601 758	Whilst public schools can still be good, I don't see why any child should receive a better education than any other child, no matter how much money they have
T6	Value 761 1029	If all schools were free to attend then eventually, I predict all schools would become much more equal, meaning that everyone would receive a much more equal education, which could eventually close the gap between rich and poor rather than widen it the way it does now
T7	Value 1041 1088	this would be incredibly difficult to implement
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 1094 1124	could it still work in theory?

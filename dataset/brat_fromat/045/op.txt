op_title: I believe that Linux is fully ready for the desktop, CMV

Some of you may not get this, but I have been using Linux as a primary OS for desktops since late 2007.

I hold my view because Linux does quite a bit of things:

 * Allows for more efficient consumption of power
 * Gives higher performance in general
 * Is a highly valuable learning experience
 * Is in most cases open source, allowing anyone to look at the code their systems use

Please change my view.

Well... America has been toppling governments and engaging in quasi-imperialistic wars since Japan was a baby. Other commenters have listed many good examples so I'm not going to repeat them. To make the discussion even fairer - because why limit the comparison to only one country? - the European empires were as bad and sometimes worse than Japan, for much longer. From essentially genociding all of North America to turning the entire Congo into a brutal slave labour camp to fighting a war with China just so they could get the whole country addicted to opium. 

When we hear about these atrocities we generally think something like "that was terrible, but it was a long time ago, and things were different." Or even if we don't rationalize it so; the genocide of Native American tribes and theft of their land doesn't carry the same emotional weight as Japan's invasion of China, or Operation Barbarossa. And the enslavement and brutal treatment of the Congolese by Belgium, while shocking, doesn't start discussions about whether or not America has moral high ground over Belgium. When is the last time someone got pissy at Britain on reddit for the Mau Mau uprising?

We keep stirring up controversy and talking about how terrible Japan was for lots of possible reasons. Here are some guesses:

1. Their atrocities are more recent (though in the big picture, not really that much more recent at all)
2. They lost the war, while the West's atrocities were usually roaring successes
3. They aren't white, and it bugs us more when non-white people do bad things than when white people do

My opinion is that Japan was, for no more than 50 years and really only like 10 of those, a bit worse than the West was on average for the previous ~300 years. And so no, America has no high ground whatsoever.

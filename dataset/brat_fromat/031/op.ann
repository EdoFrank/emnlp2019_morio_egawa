T1	Major_Claim 20 148	As disappointed as I am with current US government, its crime against humanity is nowhere near what Japanese did during WW2. CMV
T2	Value 150 444	Some people on Reddit think an American (who they thought I was one of), has no moral upperhand to criticize what Imperial Japan did to Koreans and Chineses, because of Guantanamo Bay and drone attacks (something about how Americans elected the representatives who support both of these things)
T3	Value 469 617	their implication is that Guantanamo Bay and drone attack are on the same level of crime against humanity as atrocious act of Imperial Japanese Army
T4	Value 629 719	If a Nazi sympathizer condemns what Imperial Japan did, then he/she has no moral upperhand
T5	Value 786 850	I'm not supporting neither GetMo or current use of drone attacks

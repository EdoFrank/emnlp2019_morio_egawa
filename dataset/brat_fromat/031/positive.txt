(For full disclosure, I am Korean btw)

I don't know if you can compare one country's crimes with another's. Each country's crimes are unique, and what each country did was unique to its time period and place.

That being said, the US has quite the laundry list when it comes to invalidating the sovereignty of other nations:

* Sending troops to aid the White Army during the Russian Civil War (1920's)

* Toppling Iran's democratically elected government and re-instituting the Shah's power, twice

* Basically controlling the politics and ruling governments/dictatorships of South America until very recently â€“ essentially, if a government was deemed a "threat", no matter how good to the people they were the US stepped in and immediately toppled them

* I haven't even touched the Middle East yet.

Is this nowhere near what Japan did? I don't know. I really don't think you could compare the two.

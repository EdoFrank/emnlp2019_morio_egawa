T1	Value 158 259	America has been toppling governments and engaging in quasi-imperialistic wars since Japan was a baby
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 342 432	To make the discussion even fairer - because why limit the comparison to only one country?
T3	Value 435 515	the European empires were as bad and sometimes worse than Japan, for much longer

T13	Value 1641 1658	They aren't white
T14	Value 1664 1741	it bugs us more when non-white people do bad things than when white people do
T15	Value 1762 1901	Japan was, for no more than 50 years and really only like 10 of those, a bit worse than the West was on average for the previous ~300 years
T16	Value 1914 1951	America has no high ground whatsoever

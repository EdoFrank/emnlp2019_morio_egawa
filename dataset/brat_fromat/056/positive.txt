op_title: I believe that The United States has no right to claim that it's the greatest country in the world. CMV

Here's a good copypasta devised by my good friend /u/hivemind6

All you're doing is regurgitating the Reddit narrative talking points. You're misinformed and obsessed with bashing the US to the point that your view of the US is HILARIOUSLY unrealistically negative. You criticize the US and exaggerate negatives in the US to avoid acknowledging the problems that exist in other countries including your own.

    Doesn't have universal healthcare

Yet the majority of people are insured and satisfied with their healthcare, which is superior to what exists in Europe in areas like cancer treatment.

And by the way, our healthcare system is responsible for 78% of all biotechnology research in the world. Your healthcare would be worse off if we didn't have our current system, because advancements made in the US benefit the whole world.

    has shockingly bad public transport

Due to high car ownership rates.

    most cities suffer from sprawl

Who cares?

    is politically terrifying

Is politically demonized, usually by countries who want to divert attention from their own problems.

    and has a history of awful international actions and responsibility for the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not more.

As do many countries which I'm sure you'd never criticize.

Meanwhile, the US also has a history of being responsible for the defense and freedom of several countries. Saving the world from Fascism, containing Communism, providing more humanitarian aid than any other country in history, contributing more to the world in terms of science and technology than almost every other modern country combined, leading the world in every field of academia etc..

1 The US is the most technologically advanced nation on earth:

2 The US has very high quality of life and scores 4th in the Human Development Index. This is remarkable considering our demographics We have the largest diaspora from the third world (mostly Mexico) and yet still manage to perform extremely well as a country:

3 Americans are the most generous people in the world, giving over twice as much of their income to charity as the next most generous nation.

4 Americans have the highest rate of secondary education completion out of developed countries:

5 The US has the highest education attainment out of any major industrialized nation. Americans are more likely to receive higher education than Europeans, Canadians, Australians etc...

6 The US dominates in academic performance. So not only does the US get more of its population into higher education, but the education we receive is the best in the world, and results in vastly superior academic performance in all broad subject fields when ranked among world universities.

7 Americans are the most productive workers in the world: http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20572828/

The US invented basically everything of importance in the last 100 years, without question. The inventors were either American or were working in the US, assisted by Americans. The airplane, the integrated circuit, the microprocessor, the personal computer, the laser beam, synthetic composites, digital music, the internet etc...

We now live in the information age, which the US not only created, but still rules to this day. Basically every major IT company in the world is American. Microsoft, Apple, Google, Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Cisco Systems, Oracle, Yahoo. Almost every major site is American. Every technology that you’re using to post on this website, which is an American website, was invented by Americans. Your computer is either a Mac or a PC, both are American-designed computer architectures. Your computer is running almost certainly either Mac OS or Windows, both American. You're using almost certainly an American browser and you're on the internet which transmits data via the TCP/IP protocol, an invention of the US military.

The US sequenced the human genome. An American (Norman Borlaug) was the father of the Green Revolution, creating a wheat variety that is credited with saving a billion lives. Possibly the most important human being to ever live. The US landed a man on the moon when most countries didn't have the technology to build a vacuum cleaner. The US mapped the cosmos with the Hubble telescope and dated the universe, discovered water on the moon and Mars, surveyed the outer solar system’s planets and their moons, currently has a probe exiting our solar system, the furthest and fasted object made by humans. Currently, the US is at the forefront of every possible field. Almost every innovation of note since the end of WWII has taken place with the US at the helm.

The US is an exceptional country. It's just that the current narrative about the US is singularly obsessed with tearing the US down. And the big problem is that there are people just as arrogant as Americans outside of the US who base their entire sense of pride and self-worth on comparing themselves and their country to the US. So they have a huge incentive to depict the US in the most heinously negative ways. Plus, it's just not "cool" to be pro-US. So even people who know the truth and are aware of how pathetic the anti-Americanism is are too afraid to speak up about it for fear of being ostracized. This results in people like you wallowing in ignorance. You're basically a brainwashed drone.

op_title: I don't think smoke breaks should be allowed at work, CMV

As long as EVERYONE or no one is allowed the chance to take a break. I'm a non smoker and have worked for a company who only let smokers take breaks. I can get just as frustrated and angry as they can and yet I'm not allowed to go and do something to cool off for a few minutes? I've worked with smokers who don't smoke at work at all and you would never know. Some bring "the patch" or other means to help them get through the day.

In the end it's not right to allow one to take it but not the other, no matter the reason. If someone is allowed to take a break and just don't, then that's on them.

T1	Value 80 185	It is smarter from a business manager's stand-point to keep employees happy while maintaining work output
T2	Value 187 344	The path of least resistance to achieve this, when dealing with smokers at least, is to let them have their smoke breaks and keep them in "working condition"
T3	Value 352 400	you have shown that you don't need a smoke break
T4	Value 402 488	it wouldn't make any sense from that stand-point to let you take a break for no reason
T5	Value 490 510	You don't "need" one
T6	Value 513 592	I realize that does't sound fair, but look at it from the manager's perspective
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 594 640	We have worker A and B in a door hinge factory
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 642 721	They both work at the same pace, making the same amount of door hinges per hour
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 723 757	Worker A smokes; Worker B does not
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 759 843	Worker A gets irritable and is less motivated to work if he doesn't get his nicotine
T11	Value 849 896	the manager lets him/her take their smoke break
T12	Value 900 927	they can keep up efficiency
T13	Value 941 992	there is a difference between Worker A and Worker B
T14	Value 1001 1024	B will make more hinges
T15	Value 1033 1073	they continue to work instead of smoking
T16	Value 1075 1198	that difference would be even greater if A was unhappy and couldn't get their smoke break, leading to even less door hinges
T17	Value 1207 1229	they weren't motivated
T18	Rhetorical_Statement 1231 1320	With regards to Worker B, why give them a break if they haven't expressed a need for one?
T19	Rhetorical_Statement 1321 1345	Ain't broke don't fix it
T20	Value 1375 1432	it is probably easiest to give Worker A their smoke break
T21	Value 1436 1517	we have don't have to listen to them be a little bitch about their nicotine habit

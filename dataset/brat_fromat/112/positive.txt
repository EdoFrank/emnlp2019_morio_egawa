op_title: I don't think smoke breaks should be allowed at work, CMV

It is smarter from a business manager's stand-point to keep employees happy while maintaining work output. The path of least resistance to achieve this, when dealing with smokers at least, is to let them have their smoke breaks and keep them in "working condition". Since you have shown that you don't need a smoke break, it wouldn't make any sense from that stand-point to let you take a break for no reason. You don't "need" one.

I realize that does't sound fair, but look at it from the manager's perspective. We have worker A and B in a door hinge factory. They both work at the same pace, making the same amount of door hinges per hour. Worker A smokes; Worker B does not. Worker A gets irritable and is less motivated to work if he doesn't get his nicotine. So, the manager lets him/her take their smoke break so they can keep up efficiency. Even though there is a difference between Worker A and Worker B because B will make more hinges because they continue to work instead of smoking, that difference would be even greater if A was unhappy and couldn't get their smoke break, leading to even less door hinges because they weren't motivated. With regards to Worker B, why give them a break if they haven't expressed a need for one? Ain't broke don't fix it.

And at the end of the day, it is probably easiest to give Worker A their smoke break so we have don't have to listen to them be a little bitch about their nicotine habit.

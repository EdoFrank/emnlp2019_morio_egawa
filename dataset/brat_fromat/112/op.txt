op_title: I don't think smoke breaks should be allowed at work, CMV

I am a smoker myself, but I never smoke on the clock. Hell, I don't even bring my cigarettes to work. I don't think it's fair that people who don't smoke have to work while people who do smoke (an addiction brought on by themselves) get to leave work for the 5 minutes it takes to go smoke a cigarette a few times during their shift. Three of co-workers take smoke breaks at least 4 or 5 times during a shift and I continue to work. I can't really take a break myself because I don't really have a reason to take a short break (because I don't bring my cigs to work). 

Smoke breaks have been a very common thing amongst most of the jobs I've had. So I figured there might be a good legitimate reason behind it, so I'd like to have a discussion about it. CMV. 

EDIT: [This reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1q01e8/i_dont_think_smoke_breaks_should_be_allowed_at/cd7t14x) changed my view. If someone feels the need to smoke, they'll get frustrated when they don't smoke and become less productive. To keep them productive and happy workers, they'll let them smoke to keep everything going smoothly.

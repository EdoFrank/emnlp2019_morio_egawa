op_title: I do not plan on voting. CMV

You could still support an independent that shares most of your views.  You will never find someone you agree with 100 percent of the time.

Local ballot measures matter.  Unlike voting for a person, you could be needing to vote for/against a law, school funding, local taxes (income and property).  Local races also affect our daily lives just as much as the big races that get publicity.  Crooked sheriffs, crazy judges, idiot zoning boards..  Even if you don't agree with the major party platform, you can vote for/against individuals based on their specific job performance.  

What's more important than just voting?  Actually participating.  Run for an office, no matter how small,  attend local meetings, and question your council members about their decisions.  Let them know someone is paying attention.  Submit letters to the editor of your local newspaper about your opinions of the city meetings.  Circulate petitions to get local matters on the ballots, so the issues can be subject to vote.

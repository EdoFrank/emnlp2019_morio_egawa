T1	Major_Claim 20 48	I do not plan on voting. CMV
T2	Testimony 63 116	I am a seventeen-year-old living in the United States
T3	Value 118 170	When I turn 18, I plan to register as an independent
T4	Value 172 268	when election days come around, I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot
T5	Value 270 417	I intend to remain somewhat politically involved aside from voting, at least to the extent of knowing what the issues are and where I stand on them
T6	Value 457 564	Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere
T7	Value 594 770	/r/politics was focused almost entirely on tearing Mitt Romney and the Republicans down last election season, building them up as the most evil people on the face of the planet
T8	Value 773 865	The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals
T9	Value 867 911	You cannot separate individual issues at all
T10	Value 913 1007	you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each
T11	Value 1039 1111	voters are encouraged to agree with one side on all or almost all things
T12	Value 1121 1289	a person chooses to support a side, views presented by that side will tend to appear "better" than views presented by the other side, regardless of the views themselves
T13	Value 1291 1402	People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality
T14	Value 1405 1529	The United States has many corrupt government officials and something of a culture of dissatisfaction with elected officials
T15	Value 1531 1579	I see this, in large part, as a result of voting
T16	Value 1581 1690	Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing
T17	Value 1705 1755	the process encourages--almost necessitates--lying
T18	Value 1758 1924	Even once officials have jumped through the hoops required for their elections, they will often make decisions based on what certain groups of their constituents want
T19	Value 1926 2007	You see this in actions such as the Republicans calling for a repeal of Obamacare
T20	Value 2079 2214	absurd proposals with no chance of succeeding, created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them
T21	Value 2234 2269	voting itself depends on the people
T22	Value 2275 2317	that is perhaps my biggest problem with it
T23	Value 2319 2350	Everybody is encouraged to vote
T24	Value 2352 2498	If a person doesn't vote (and makes that clear), they are generally looked down upon--often considered unworthy of even holding political opinions
T25	Value 2500 2558	Becoming politically informed is given much lower priority
T26	Value 2573 2632	this results in people voting when they really shouldn't be
T27	Value 2634 2818	voting not because they care, not because they have honestly and thoroughly researched and come to the conclusion that Candidate A is superior to Candidate B, but because it's expected
T28	Value 2820 2865	This gives the informed votes much less value
T29	Value 2867 2931	every thoughtful vote is drowned out by a dozen thoughtless ones
T30	Value 2952 3018	voting gives people a sense of having "done their political duty."
T31	Value 3019 3053	It is an entirely symbolic gesture
T32	Value 3055 3114	individual votes, of course, do not carry any weight at all
T33	Value 3120 3165	it frees them from doing any more politically
T34	Rhetorical_Statement 3167 3233	If you're a voter, you've Done Your Part to support the democracy!
T35	Value 3361 3438	I prefer the symbolic gesture of not voting to the symbolic gesture of voting
T36	Value 3447 3519	I see a lot of systemic problems caused by the act and concept of voting

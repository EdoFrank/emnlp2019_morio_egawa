I have a few objections to your reasoning, and I'll do my best to explain them.

&gt; Voting, at least in the United States encourages an us-versus-them mentality, creating a vicious atmosphere.

Wrong.  It's been shown that it's not *voting* that creates the Us vs Them atmosphere, but that such thinking is inherent to the labels themselves.  There was an experiment [edit: [Link](http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/06/how-do-you-tell-when-the-news-is-biased/?utm_source=arstechnica)] which presented subjects with the same media clip, but with a lead in emphasizing divisive labels (eg "We're trying to find the opinions of Republicans/Democrats/Conservatives/Liberals on the following news report"), unifying labeles ("...opinions of Americans...") or without labels at all ("...opinions..."), and the first group reacted significantly more strongly to the partisan slant than the third group, who reacted more strongly than the 2nd.

As such, it is not *voting* for a republican or a democrat that makes you more partisan, but *thinking* of yourself as a republican or democrat (or any label, really).

&gt; The voter is asked to accept a political party's complete list of economic and social ideals. You cannot separate individual issues at all--you have a few packages to choose from, no matter how much you may disagree with parts of each.

This is the nature of representative democracy.  Except because we're not a parliamentary system, in the US we don't vote for a *party's* ideals, but on a *candidate's* ideals.  

That said no candidate's ideals match yours to the point that you can vote for them in good conscience, then by all means, don't vote for them, but to decide ahead of time that it's not *possible* for a Republican or Democrat to hold  the same values as you do is just as horrible a prejudice as deciding ahead of time that a black person or white person cannot, either; in both cases, you're treating people as their labels, rather than as people.

&gt; People who join and actively support one political party or another submit to a certain degree of mob mentality.

This is true, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't *vote,* it means you should not join a party.  So long as you continue to *actively* think of yourself as independent, you will be able to resist that trend.

&gt; Voting selects for traits such as charisma, popular appeal, and so forth, rather than competency in governing.

Wait, you're rational enough to see that he masses *don't* think, yet you're just going to sit back and let them run the elections?  That's silly.  If you're better than that, vote on *substance.*  Places like ballotpedia collect lots of good information on all the topics and candidates on your ballot.  If you do your research, you can balance out at least one Charisma based vote with your Competence based vote.

&gt;  created purely to show that the politicians uphold the views of those who voted for them

...but that's their *job,* to reflect the will of the people who elected them.  You wouldn't ridicule a state for enacting an initiative "purely because doing so upholds the views of the people who voted in favor of it," would you?  What's different here?



And my final challenge is possibly the most important one:

&gt; I intend to go to the polling location and submit a blank ballot

That, fren, is *worse* than not voting.  That potentially enables [an unethical poll worker](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/03/11/cincinnati-poll-worker-charged-with-voting-half-dozen-times-in-november/) to submit a vote in your name.  Besides, isn't that doing exactly what you're complaining about in your antepenultimate paragraph?  "If you're a [blank] voter, you've Done Your Part to ~~support the democracy~~ protest!"?

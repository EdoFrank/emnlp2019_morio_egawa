T1	Major_Claim 21 93	I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV
T2	Value 95 312	The level of derision heaped on Twilight has little to do with the actual quality of the films or books and a lot to do with men not being able to cope with the fact that there is a successful franchise aimed at women
T3	Value 450 537	Worse still is the patronising argument that Twilight is a bad influence on young women
T4	Value 539 672	This no doubt made by the same people who would have a spasm if you suggested that Video games have a deleterious affect on young men
T5	Value 674 759	Young women are quite capable of recognising the distinction between fact and fiction
T6	Value 762 956	I can offer no evidence as this is my opinion but what set me thinking was [this](http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/24/twilight-breaking-dawn-teenage-girls) piece in The Guardian

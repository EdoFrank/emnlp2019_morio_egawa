T1	Value 95 141	I'm a woman, and I'm very critical of Twilight
T2	Value 150 173	the writing is horrible
T3	Value 176 299	In addition to the bad writing, it's a thinly-veiled pro-life parable that encourages young women to be weak and submissive
T4	Value 301 387	In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character
T5	Value 389 449	You don't see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series
T6	Value 477 512	they are aimed at similar audiences
T7	Value 515 636	I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own
T8	Value 638 697	She isn't reliant upon a man to provide her with self worth
T9	Value 699 812	She's not chasing the men around, begging for their affection, and trying to kill herself because she is rebuffed
T10	Value 814 841	She's a self-assured badass
T11	Value 844 917	When you say that young women are able to tell fact from fiction, I agree
T12	Value 919 956	This is not the problem with Twilight
T13	Value 958 1014	The problem is that it acts as an agent of socialization
T14	Value 1016 1133	Young women internalize the idea that loving someone means being submissive, devoted to the point of self-destruction
T15	Value 1135 1294	It's a dangerous concept for young women to internalize, just as it's dangerous for young men to think it's okay to treat women as sex objects without feelings
T16	Value 1296 1460	As a society, we discourage our young people from viewing certain behaviors in a positive light through negative sanctions, and I think that's what's happening here
T17	Value 1463 1527	I also hated The Da Vinci code because the writing was atrocious
T18	Rhetorical_Statement 1529 1556	Same with 50 shades of gray
T19	Value 1558 1595	There is a lot of bad prose out there

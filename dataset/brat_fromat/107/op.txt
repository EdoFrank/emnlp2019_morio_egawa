op_title: I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV

The level of derision heaped on Twilight has little to do with the actual quality of the films or books and a lot to do with men not being able to cope with the fact that there is a successful franchise aimed at women. Worse still at young women. And don't get us started on Twilight moms. Lets slag them off in the queue for Man of Steel or Iron Man 3.

Worse still is the patronising argument that Twilight is a bad influence on young women. This no doubt made by the same people who would have a spasm if you suggested that Video games have a deleterious affect on young men. Young women are quite capable of recognising the distinction between fact and fiction.

I can offer no evidence as this is my opinion but what set me thinking was [this](http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/24/twilight-breaking-dawn-teenage-girls) piece in The Guardian.

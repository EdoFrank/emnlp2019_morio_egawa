op_title: I believe the criticism of Twilight is just thinly veiled misogynysm CMV

I'm a woman, and I'm very critical of Twilight because the writing is horrible.  In addition to the bad writing, it's a thinly-veiled pro-life parable that encourages young women to be weak and submissive. In comparison, The Hunger Games is well written and features a strong female character. You don't see nearly as much vitriol directed at this series, in spite of the fact that they are aimed at similar audiences.  I attribute this to the fact that the writing is much better and the lead is powerful, talented, and smart all on her own. She isn't reliant upon a man to provide her with self worth. She's not chasing the men around, begging for their affection, and trying to kill herself because she is rebuffed. She's a self-assured badass.

When you say that young women are able to tell fact from fiction, I agree. This is not the problem with Twilight. The problem is that it acts as an agent of socialization. Young women internalize the idea that loving someone means being submissive, devoted to the point of self-destruction. It's a dangerous concept for young women to internalize, just as it's dangerous for young men to think it's okay to treat women as sex objects without feelings. As a society, we discourage our young people from viewing certain behaviors in a positive light through negative sanctions, and I think that's what's happening here.

I also hated The Da Vinci code because the writing was atrocious. Same with 50 shades of gray. There is a lot of bad prose out there.

op_title: I think most conspiracy theories are true, but are downplayed by higher powers to make everyone think they are ridiculous, CMV.

Can't find the source right now, but I've seen a couple of studies that indicate that people prefer to think that there's somebody in charge and they are evil rather than think nobody is in charge.

If there is somebody in charge, you can blame that somebody for the evils of the world. "No way a lone gunman could kill a president, there must be some shadow organization behind it!".

The truth is, nobody is in charge, and nobody knows what they are doing, everyone is making it up as they go along. Scarier is that our current social structure is built on the premise that we should keep it, nothing more. As we can see clearly from the arab sprint, our social order is highly fragile and can crumble easily to the slightest of provocations.

It's much more comforting to most people to think that there's some big evil order imposed from above (be it god or a shadow government) than to face the fact that the world is random, the world is unjust, and nobody holds control over it, it's all just one big mess. 

Nobody in the "higher ups" decides that a president should be killed or some buildings should be destroyed, lone crazies do it, and in some cases other people fail to stop them. As comforting as it is to think that somebody is in charge, and he has a (however evil) plan for us, that's not the case in reality, there's no plan, there's no order, there's no justice, there's no right and wrong, there is complete chaos.

If that sounded too scary for you to comprehend, don't blame people who just can't comprehend that and insist to believe in some higher order, even in an evil one, because even an evil order is better than pure chaos, to some people.

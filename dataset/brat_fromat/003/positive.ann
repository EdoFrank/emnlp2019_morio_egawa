T1	Testimony 185 344	I've seen a couple of studies that indicate that people prefer to think that there's somebody in charge and they are evil rather than think nobody is in charge
T2	Value 347 433	If there is somebody in charge, you can blame that somebody for the evils of the world
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 435 531	"No way a lone gunman could kill a president, there must be some shadow organization behind it!"
T4	Value 534 648	The truth is, nobody is in charge, and nobody knows what they are doing, everyone is making it up as they go along
T5	Value 650 755	Scarier is that our current social structure is built on the premise that we should keep it, nothing more
T6	Value 757 891	As we can see clearly from the arab sprint, our social order is highly fragile and can crumble easily to the slightest of provocations
T7	Value 894 1160	It's much more comforting to most people to think that there's some big evil order imposed from above (be it god or a shadow government) than to face the fact that the world is random, the world is unjust, and nobody holds control over it, it's all just one big mess
T8	Value 1164 1340	Nobody in the "higher ups" decides that a president should be killed or some buildings should be destroyed, lone crazies do it, and in some cases other people fail to stop them
T9	Value 1342 1581	As comforting as it is to think that somebody is in charge, and he has a (however evil) plan for us, that's not the case in reality, there's no plan, there's no order, there's no justice, there's no right and wrong, there is complete chaos
T10	Policy 1584 1746	If that sounded too scary for you to comprehend, don't blame people who just can't comprehend that and insist to believe in some higher order, even in an evil one
T11	Value 1756 1816	even an evil order is better than pure chaos, to some people

op_title: I think most conspiracy theories are true, but are downplayed by higher powers to make everyone think they are ridiculous, CMV.

I think it's fair to say there are genuine conspiracies in the world.  Powerful people do in fact conspire to gain power and money.  But the difference between "most" conspiracy theories and legitimate ones (Watergate, etc.) is standard of evidence.  Most conspiracy theorists come up with their theories in a self-sealing way, such that they cannot be disconfirmed.  Any evidence they find contradicting the idea can be easily dismissed as propaganda by the conspirators or incorporated into their alternate reality narrative.

[This article](http://scienceblogs.com/denialism/2013/02/26/what-happens-when-you-study-conspiracy-theories-the-conspiracy-theorists-make-up-conspiracy-theories-about-you/) discusses a group of scientists who had the opportunity to study conspiracy theories forming in real time.  You can see the flaws in reasoning and immunity to falsification conspiracy theories suffer from.

I guess it's possible that through flawed reasoning and inconsistent standards of evidence that most conspiracy theorists have stumbled upon the truth merely by chance, but that seems implausible.  The best way will always be to examine the actual facts with each theory.  What do we find out when we consider all objections?

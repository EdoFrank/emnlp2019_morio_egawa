T1	Value 101 143	Kantiab Ethics has a few glaring holes IMO
T2	Value 145 254	The first is that the idea that, "an action can be considered good if it can be willed as a universal maxim."
T3	Value 261 300	not everyone will ever agree on a maxim
T4	Value 305 343	they're can never be a universal maxim
T5	Value 359 421	"Do not kill." that can easily be considered a universal maxim
T6	Value 431 498	there are a thousand reasons &amp; oppositions you can give to that
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 500 520	What if your in war?
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 521 555	What if you're defending yourself?
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 556 589	What your forced to kill someone?
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 590 638	What if your religion tells you to kill someone?
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 639 680	Or what if you just enjoy killing people?
T12	Value 682 831	Another major problem is that in order to create these maxims Kan says we must eliminate all are emotional connections &amp; think purely with reason
T13	Value 833 851	This is impossible
T14	Rhetorical_Statement 853 857	Why?
T15	Value 866 932	your very way of thinking is based upon your emotional connections
T16	Value 934 1108	The things you may consider "bad" or "good" is based purely upon the ideas that you have formed based upon numerous encounters with friends, family, strangers &amp; the media
T17	Value 1110 1154	It's impossible to divide yourself from this
T18	Value 1157 1229	Kant's perspective from the very start asks too much &amp; is impossible
T19	Value 1231 1256	We are rational creatures
T20	Value 1262 1351	our rationality of what is ethical comes from what our environment has told us is ethical
T21	Value 1359 1402	no one can every agree on a universal maxim
T22	Value 1407 1450	there by definition is no "universal" maxim

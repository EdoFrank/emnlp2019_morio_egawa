op_title: I believe that Kantian ethics stands as a good guide to live your life by. CMV.

Kantiab Ethics has a few glaring holes IMO. The first is that the idea that, "an action can be considered good if it can be willed as a universal maxim."

 But not everyone will ever agree on a maxim, so they're can never be a universal maxim. For instance, "Do not kill." that can easily be considered a universal maxim. And yet there are a thousand reasons &amp; oppositions you can give to that. What if your in war? What if you're defending yourself? What your forced to kill someone? What if your religion tells you to kill someone? Or what if you just enjoy killing people?

Another major problem is that in order to create these maxims Kan says we must eliminate all are emotional connections &amp; think purely with reason. This is impossible. Why? Because your very way of thinking is based upon your emotional connections. The things you may consider "bad" or "good" is based purely upon the ideas that you have formed based upon numerous encounters with friends, family, strangers &amp; the media. It's impossible to divide yourself from this.

Kant's perspective from the very start asks too much &amp; is impossible. We are rational creatures, but our rationality of what is ethical comes from what our environment has told us is ethical, &amp; no one can every agree on a universal maxim, so there by definition is no "universal" maxim

Well Kantian ethics is ridiculous. 

Either you take it very literally, in which case you're not allowed to be consequentialist. So you can't lie to the Nazi officer who wants to know if you're sheltering any jews. 

Or, you make mini situation specific categorical imperatives, so, everyone should always lie when a nazi officer comes to the door and asks if there is a jewish man in your house. Problem with this is, it's tautologous, all it's saying is that in every situation do the right thing. It's not helpful, really it's just the doctrine of double effect/consequentialism framed really unhelpfully.

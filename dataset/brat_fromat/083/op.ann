T1	Major_Claim 20 80	I don't think "ending the R-word" is a worthwhile goal. CMV.
T2	Value 82 293	For those who are unfamiliar with the campaigns to "end the R-word," it is essentially a movement to stop the use of the word "retarded" being used as an insult or as a casual descriptor for something being dumb
T3	Value 295 387	The reasons for this are that it is insulting to those who actually have mental disabilities
T4	Value 390 453	The reasons I don't think this goal is worthwhile are threefold
T5	Value 458 538	I do not see it as being any different from calling someone blind, deaf, or lame
T6	Value 540 610	It is simply another disability that is used to exaggerate a situation
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 613 648	How did you not see that huge sign?
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 649 663	Are you blind?
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 665 675	Acceptable
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 678 728	How did you not hear that car horn blaring at you?
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 729 742	Are you deaf?
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 744 754	Acceptable
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 756 791	"How did you get that answer wrong?
T14	Rhetorical_Statement 792 809	Are you retarded?
T15	Rhetorical_Statement 811 823	Unacceptable
T16	Value 827 936	My theory for *why* this is the case is that people see mental retardation as more integral to who people are
T17	Value 938 1088	If you imply that being blind is bad, that's ok, that's obvious and blind people are more than their disability; they are a person *with* a disability
T18	Value 1090 1197	If you imply that being mentally retarded is bad, you are directly insulting and belittling retarded people
T19	Value 1218 1383	this mentality has the negative effect of us further stigmatizing mentally retarded individuals by forcing us to see the disability and the person as one in the same
T20	Value 1389 1433	People are not going to stop using this word
T21	Value 1446 1565	people compare this campaign with efforts to end the use of the word "gay" to casually describe something as being dumb
T22	Value 1567 1682	It is undeniable that mainstream use of that word has decreased in recent years, partially due to similar campaigns
T23	Value 1693 1942	the difference is that there is no inherent disadvantage to being gay; the only reason homosexuals are disadvantaged is because of society, and as society's opinions changed on gay persons, it made less sense to use that descriptor in a negative way
T24	Value 1944 2126	Retardation, on the other hand, is inherently disadvantageous and entails lower measures on intelligence tests and self-sufficiency, much like being blind or deaf are disadvantageous
T25	Value 2134 2191	in the future we may see nearly no prejudice against gays
T26	Value 2193 2286	it will never seem weird to consider mental retardation as being disadvantageous and negative
T27	Value 2291 2428	The casual use of the word retarded came about due to its initial designation as a clinical descriptor for those with mental disabilities
T28	Value 2430 2553	Even if we were to somehow end the casual use of the word, it would simply be replaced by whatever the new clinical term is
T29	Value 2568 2751	people will continue to draw a comparison to this disability, which is defined by lower intelligence, when describing things and actions that are defined by their lack of intelligence
T30	Rhetorical_Statement 2757 2774	there you have it
T31	Value 2920 2978	I do not think that ending the R-word is a worthwhile goal
T32	Value 2987 3088	it is no different from casually calling someone deaf or blind, people will continue to use this term
T33	Value 3097 3222	retardation is inherently a disadvantage, and even if the campaign works, people would just start using the new clinical term
T34	Value 3230 3384	by making the rules different for retardation than deafness or blindness, it implies that retarded people *are* their disability instead of affected by it

op_title: I don't think "ending the R-word" is a worthwhile goal. CMV.

I think it is a worthwhile goal, but not a very practical one. Changing public lexicon is quite a stretch.  

But there's a very simple reason why it *shouldn't* be used. It's offensive to people who do have intellectual disabilities. I work with students like this, and they've been called the "r-word" their entire lives, and it brings up terrible memories of bullying and unequal treatment since as far back as they can remember. 

While it may seem silly or unnecessary to us, it's the equivalent of walking into a gay bar and calling someone a faggot. It's all about being decent to one another.

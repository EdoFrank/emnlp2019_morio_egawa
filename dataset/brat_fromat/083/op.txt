op_title: I don't think "ending the R-word" is a worthwhile goal. CMV.

For those who are unfamiliar with the campaigns to "end the R-word," it is essentially a movement to stop the use of the word "retarded" being used as an insult or as a casual descriptor for something being dumb. The reasons for this are that it is insulting to those who actually have mental disabilities.

The reasons I don't think this goal is worthwhile are threefold:

* I do not see it as being any different from calling someone blind, deaf, or lame. It is simply another disability that is used to exaggerate a situation. "How did you not see that huge sign? Are you blind?" Acceptable. "How did you not hear that car horn blaring at you? Are you deaf?" Acceptable. "How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?" Unacceptable. 

My theory for *why* this is the case is that people see mental retardation as more integral to who people are. If you imply that being blind is bad, that's ok, that's obvious and blind people are more than their disability; they are a person *with* a disability. If you imply that being mentally retarded is bad, you are directly insulting and belittling retarded people. I would argue that this mentality has the negative effect of us further stigmatizing mentally retarded individuals by forcing us to see the disability and the person as one in the same. 

* People are not going to stop using this word. Oftentimes people compare this campaign with efforts to end the use of the word "gay" to casually describe something as being dumb. It is undeniable that mainstream use of that word has decreased in recent years, partially due to similar campaigns. However, the difference is that there is no inherent disadvantage to being gay; the only reason homosexuals are disadvantaged is because of society, and as society's opinions changed on gay persons, it made less sense to use that descriptor in a negative way. Retardation, on the other hand, is inherently disadvantageous and entails lower measures on intelligence tests and self-sufficiency, much like being blind or deaf are disadvantageous. While in the future we may see nearly no prejudice against gays, it will never seem weird to consider mental retardation as being disadvantageous and negative.

* The casual use of the word retarded came about due to its initial designation as a clinical descriptor for those with mental disabilities. Even if we were to somehow end the casual use of the word, it would simply be replaced by whatever the new clinical term is. As I stated, people will continue to draw a comparison to this disability, which is defined by lower intelligence, when describing things and actions that are defined by their lack of intelligence.

So there you have it. Hopefully you can change my view and help me see why we should be putting forth the time and effort to "end the R-word." Thanks, guys.

**TL;DR I do not think that ending the R-word is a worthwhile goal because it is no different from casually calling someone deaf or blind, people will continue to use this term because retardation is inherently a disadvantage, and even if the campaign works, people would just start using the new clinical term. Also, by making the rules different for retardation than deafness or blindness, it implies that retarded people *are* their disability instead of affected by it. CMV.**

Edit: /u/Shadygaga and /u/jwhitx changed my view! I'm enjoying this conversation, though, so I'd still love to see what you all have to say.

Edit 2: /u/OctopusPirate shifted my view back to my initial position by [rebutting the points made by the previously mentioned users](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1l4s6s/i_dont_think_ending_the_rword_is_a_worthwhile/cbw5mb8). This conversation has given me a lot to think about, though.

op_title: I don't think "ending the R-word" is a worthwhile goal. CMV.

The reason ”How did you get that answer wrong? Are you retarded?” is unacceptable is because not every answer a person with intellectual disabilities (the universally accepted description, for everyones information) is wrong. 

Sometimes they give correct answers, and not just because of luck! The people I work with try especially hard to learn and be correct when giving input.

I know this was just an example, and you probably have many others in mind, but there *is* a difference between a blind person not being able to see (they can't), and a ”retard” not being able to answer anything right (they sometimes can't, just like you or I).

For the record, the people I work with are apathetic to the ”r word”, in every sense. They are also aware that they have special needs, and would prefer if the public stop walking on eggshells trying to explain it in any other way. Does that mean you should go around palling around with the friendly retards at the YMCA like your best buds? Probably not :)

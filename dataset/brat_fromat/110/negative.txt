Never say never.  15 or 20 years from now there could be a whole new crew in charge of the party that takes the party in a much more favorable direction.  They will never try to turn their act around if they will never get your vote (or the vote of others who think like you).  But if you say "I don't like what you guys have been doing lately, but if you change your ways by doing X, Y, and Z then maybe I will vote for you in the future." then they have a motivation to take those action to try and secure your vote for the future.  Don't polarize politics more than you have to, make the parties compete with each other for your vote.

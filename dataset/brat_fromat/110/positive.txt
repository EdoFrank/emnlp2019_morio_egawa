op_title: Disgusted by their antics, I will never vote Republican. CMV

The Republican Party was the one that freed the slaves. The ideas and the goals of the parties change. Saying that you will never vote for another party 

You've also removed part of the need for the Republican party to change. They now know they will never get your vote, so why try to change in a way that would have gotten your vote?

Let's use you're NSA example. What if you knew that, 100% guaranteed, the next Republican President would end domestic spying? And while he was at it he fixed poverty, crime, and accomplished world peace? An extreme but you get the idea. You've pledged to never vote republican, so it doesn't matter. Vote on the issue, not on what party they align with.

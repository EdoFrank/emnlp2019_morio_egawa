op_title: Disgusted by their antics, I will never vote Republican. CMV

Aside from maybe dogcatcher, Republicans' political antics and many of their policy stances have disgusted me to the point where I can scarcely consider voting for them even a hypothetical option.

* I consider the Shutdown and earlier budgetary show-downs to be exceedingly irresponsible of the Republicans, a party that likes to claim the mantle of responsibility.
* I find it callous that the GOP claims the debt and reducing the size of government are the highest priority when their efforts directly hurt people already suffering in a period of slow job recovery.
* The GOP's strong ties to the Religious Right are anathema to me. I am an atheist, and I support a scientifically informed view on public policy. Pushing things like prayer in schools, "intelligent design," denying climate change, restrictive sexual mores, and the notion that the United States is a "Christian nation" turn me off.
* I am not a fan of gun violence (okay, well, who could disagree with that?). I believe we can find reasonable safeguards to reduce the rate of gun violence and number of guns while preserving 2nd Amendment rights. I understand gun culture and hunting are a major part of the rural lifestyle in America, but in urban areas, we associate guns more with crime and murder.
* The Republicans like to talk the talk about civil liberties, but I don't think John McCain or Mitt Romney would have done things much differently from Obama in regard to NSA surveillance and other aspects of security theater.
* I think we spend too much on the military and rather that money be spent on a social welfare: infrastructure, education, research.

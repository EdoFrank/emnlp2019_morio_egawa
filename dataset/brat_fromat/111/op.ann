T1	Major_Claim 21 279	I believe in equal-opportunity meritocracy, but I also think winners use their power to cheat and lock in advantages. The solution is to reset opportunity by seizing and redistributing wealth every 50 years so the winners have to keep proving themselves. CMV
T2	Value 480 601	I know how disruptive a 50 year reset would be, but I think if the winners really deserve their status they can handle it
T3	Value 603 779	They will naturally rise to the top after each reset and so much room will be made for disruptive innovation that any society that does this will soar ahead of those that don’t
T4	Policy 783 853	Note that I don't want to dismantle firms, just redistribute ownership
T5	Value 856 986	I can imagine how hard this would be to implement, especially if it could not be done globally, but I think it’s a worthwhile goal
T6	Value 995 1077	everyone needs to feel they live in a true meritocracy instead of a corrupt system
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 1079 1134	Maybe a constitutional convention would make it happen?
T8	Value 1547 1595	These are the things winners should be judged on
T9	Value 1599 1673	It takes a little communism to keep capitalism working... unless I'm wrong

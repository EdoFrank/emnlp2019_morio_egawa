op_title: I believe in equal-opportunity meritocracy, but I also think winners use their power to cheat and lock in advantages. The solution is to reset opportunity by seizing and redistributing wealth every 50 years so the winners have to keep proving themselves. CMV

Cheating methods include: test prep, prep schools, legacy admissions, gifts to schools, inheritance, nepotism, racism. Let's put a stop to all this so we live up to the ideal of equal opportunity. 

I know how disruptive a 50 year reset would be, but I think if the winners really deserve their status they can handle it. They will naturally rise to the top after each reset and so much room will be made for disruptive innovation that any society that does this will soar ahead of those that don’t. 

Note that I don't want to dismantle firms, just redistribute ownership.

I can imagine how hard this would be to implement, especially if it could not be done globally, but I think it’s a worthwhile goal because everyone needs to feel they live in a true meritocracy instead of a corrupt system. Maybe a constitutional convention would make it happen?

Forms of wealth to redistribute continuously over time: education, food, health care, &amp; traditional public goods like water, roads, justice, etc. Forms of wealth to seize and redistribute every 50 years: money, land, valuable contracts, stocks, bonds, futures, derivatives, and other financial instruments. 

Forms of wealth that can’t be redistributed: innate intelligence, sociability, creativity, drive. These are the things winners should be judged on. 

It takes a little communism to keep capitalism working... unless I'm wrong.

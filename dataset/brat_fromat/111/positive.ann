T1	Value 281 319	It doesn't work because of game theory
T2	Value 321 449	There's a famous game called the Prisoner's Dilemma (which reflects lots of real-world situations), in which you have two people
T3	Fact 451 637	Each person benefits from being cooperated with, the benefit from not cooperating with the other person, and both people benefit more from both cooperating than from both not cooperating
T4	Value 640 820	In order for people to cooperate when they can't make binding agreements, they have to have the reason of trying to get their partner to cooperate in a future iteration of the game
T5	Value 822 966	There's a proof of this; the best way to play the Prisoner's Dilemma is to start by cooperating, and then do whatever your partner did last time
T6	Value 978 1048	this breaks down if you know exactly how long the game is going to run
T7	Value 1050 1176	In the final iteration, neither person has any incentive to cooperate (since there are no more future iterations to influence)
T8	Value 1181 1209	they will both not cooperate
T9	Value 1217 1246	this outcome can't be changed
T10	Value 1248 1304	there's no reason to cooperate in the next-to-last round
T11	Value 1316 1414	there's no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last, and so on all the way back to the first round
T12	Value 1417 1524	To avoid that problem, you need to make the resets based on something random, and make them happen suddenly

It doesn't work because of game theory. There's a famous game called the Prisoner's Dilemma (which reflects lots of real-world situations), in which you have two people. Each person benefits from being cooperated with, the benefit from not cooperating with the other person, and both people benefit more from both cooperating than from both not cooperating.

In order for people to cooperate when they can't make binding agreements, they have to have the reason of trying to get their partner to cooperate in a future iteration of the game. There's a proof of this; the best way to play the Prisoner's Dilemma is to start by cooperating, and then do whatever your partner did last time.

However, this breaks down if you know exactly how long the game is going to run. In the final iteration, neither person has any incentive to cooperate (since there are no more future iterations to influence), so they will both not cooperate. Since this outcome can't be changed, there's no reason to cooperate in the next-to-last round, therefore there's no reason to cooperate in the third-to-last, and so on all the way back to the first round.

To avoid that problem, you need to make the resets based on something random, and make them happen suddenly.

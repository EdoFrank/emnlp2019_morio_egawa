op_title: I think the only currently available way to get rid of HIV/AIDs is to start quarantining people who have the disease. CMV.

[Quarantine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine)

Edit Note: I do not think people with AIDS should be quarantined in the traditional sense (I.e. Isolated from the community). Im thinking more along the lines of a voluntary online database, perhaps one that could only be accessed if the person with AIDS told you to check it. Something like this:

* person A finds out he/she has AIDS

* Person A then registers on this database, and informs his/her previous sexual partners. These people are sent a message with login information.

* this could lead to people getting themselves checked out, and could lead to more people registering, informing their sexual partners, etc.

I'm not sure of the logistics or how this would work out, but basically I think that people who have the disease HIV/AIDS need to be quarantined, added to a registry, or something like that so that they stop spreading the disease. We've spent Billions on AIDs research, but the current pharmaceutical technology we have isn't sophisticated enough to eradicate this disease. In the mean time, quarantining is the only other option we have.

I know there could be a lot of social stigma around people who were quarantined, but I don't think it has to be that invasive (privacy wise). People with AIDS could be entered into a database that people without AIDS could check prior to engaging in sexual relations or the sharing of needles. That way, you (hopefully) wouldn't be discriminated against if you were buying a house, applying for a job, etc.

I'll be back in a few hours. Thanks /r/changemyview!

Edit: Thanks everyone! While I was definitely on the fence about this, the information presented here was excellent and definitely changed my view!

op_title: I think the only currently available way to get rid of HIV/AIDs is to start quarantining people who have the disease. CMV.

Many others have said something similar to this, but I think it's good to restate:

AIDS is way more a socioeconomical problem than a health issue. Condoms are inexpensive and very efficient to prevent infection and people being treated has almost zero chance of transmitting it.

The world right now have technology and money to get rid of AIDS before finding it's cure, but we lack of information and distribution of this money.

The said "risk" population are almost always in this situation because they don't know they should prevent themselves (like old people, who's been the most affected by the disease in developed countries) or people that suffers from bad governments, by the lack of condoms and treatment to infected. Plus, the people that uses injectable drugs, which is itself a social issue and people that gets infected in hospitals by blood tranfers and instruments, which is also related to investment in health.

The simple bureacratic action of registering the infected has no effect at all above the real causes of AIDS spread.

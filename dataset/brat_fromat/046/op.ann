T2	Value 210 323	I do not think people with AIDS should be quarantined in the traditional sense (I.e. Isolated from the community)
T3	Value 325 474	Im thinking more along the lines of a voluntary online database, perhaps one that could only be accessed if the person with AIDS told you to check it
T4	Value 685 822	this could lead to people getting themselves checked out, and could lead to more people registering, informing their sexual partners, etc

op_title: I think the only currently available way to get rid of HIV/AIDs is to start quarantining people who have the disease. CMV.

People can already voluntarily disclose their status; it's the ones that don't know or are lying you need to watch out for. And you already have a legal obligation to notify any any past and future partners if you have a positive HIV test. Failing to do so is a serious offense.

If you mean medical reccords, obviously that already exists. But if you mean public database like rapists? That is a very dangerous implication. As I posted earlier, people will already hold your criminal history hostage for money. Victimizing people further for doing nothing but having an incurable disease is a terrible idea, as it will lead them to lying about it. By implementing these measures, you will terrify any involved, and actively discourage them from seeking treatment (as they will land on the AIDSWATCH.GOV). People will be more likely to lie about being healthy.

op_title: I think religious people are incapable of logical thought, CMV

I am a climatologist and since I started my job at USDA about a year ago, I've run into two types of people who make my life a living hell:

* There are government employees from federal and state agencies who deny climate change because "man doesn't have that much control over god's creations". 

* Even worse, there are some who say they simply don't care what happens on earth because it's only "the first step" of their eternal lives. They plan on being dead and in heaven, and whatever happens here on Earth is inconsequential. 

When I run into kinds of colleagues, I try to explain to them the science of what's happening. However, their responses ultimately lead them to some sort of anomalous thought patterns where their logic clearly breaks down, and science doesn't matter.

**I believe religious people at some point in their thought processes are not capable of logic, or choose to believe things their scientific minds tell them is clearly false.**

**CMV.**

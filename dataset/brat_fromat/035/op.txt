op_title: I think that charging different demographics different rates on car insurance is unjust. CMV.

As an 18 year old guy, I get charged an astronomical rate for car insurance. I am a conscientious and safe driver and have never gotten a ticket or gotten in an accident. I don't think it's fair to make me pay significantly more money than other people just because of my age. I understand that young men are the most likely demographic to get into an accident, but that does not warrant discriminating against every individual in the group. We understand that a cop treating a black man differently than a white man is wrong, even though the black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime than a white man in many areas. I believe this logic should be applied to insurance rates. Anyway, CMV.

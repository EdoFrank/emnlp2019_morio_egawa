This one is actually pretty simple. If insurance companies couldn't discriminate based on things like age for drivers, they just wouldn't insure those higher risk groups. If they had to charge the same rate for 18 year old's as they did for 40 year old's, they would lose money on that age group. What's the point of being in the business of insuring people if you're going to lose money doing it? Insurance companies aren't charities.

Even though you may individually be a good driver, there is no way for a company to ascertain that. All they can measure is the group's statistics, and unfortunately that's where your peer group screws you.

One other point: there is nothing about blackness that says anything about whether you will be a criminal or not. There are things like poverty and lack of education (unfortunately related to being black in America) that influence criminality, and that's why you might say a black man has a statistically higher chance of committing a crime in certain areas. The cause isn't because a person is black or white though. Being young ,however, does have a direct impact on how good a driver you are likely to be though, due to the way the brain develops.

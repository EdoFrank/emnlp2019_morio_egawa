op_title: I believe that the new "score hiding" system is poorly done and only makes viewing comment threads more annoying. CMV

Often I find myself following the opinion of the mass. When I see a comment is controversial, I become especially critical to what is being said. And when I see a comment that has a very good upvote downvote ratio I rarely disagree, because I don't expect myself to.

So I think it forces people to think more for themselves and not follow the hive mind.

It's true that the sort order wasn't changed, this is necessary to not change the concept of Reddit's upvote system too much. It's a good compromise in my opinion, especially for discussion based subreddits like CMV.

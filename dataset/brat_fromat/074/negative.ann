T1	Rhetorical_Statement 76 153	What exactly was the benefit of these unknown insiders destroying building 7?
T2	Value 154 287	It accomplished nothing compared to the Twin Towers and Pentagon in terms of boosting public support for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan
T3	Value 292 380	the only other theory I can think of was that there was some sensitive data stored there
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 382 525	In which case, wouldn't these "insiders" have a much easier job sneaking in and destroying the data rather than destroying the entire building?
T5	Fact 641 700	they were being piledriven by all the building on top of it
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 702 771	Think about how much weight was at and above where the two planes hit
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 773 854	How many tons of metal, concrete, etc. came down the minute the collapse started?
T8	Value 855 898	That much weight is pretty much unstoppable
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 959 1069	Have you seen the amount of wiring and explosives that normal demolitions companies use to destroy a building?
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 1070 1114	How much time it takes to set that stuff up?
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1115 1201	How much more time it would take to set it all up but have it all be perfectly hidden?
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1202 1331	How could these "insiders" sneak into the building undetected by security personnel and janitorial staff and do all of this work?
T13	Value 1332 1379	Work by the way that was **impossibly durable**
T14	Fact 1388 1452	it all survived the impact of a jetliner and the subsequent fire
T15	Rhetorical_Statement 1455 1599	How do you design a demolition project (which is by it's very nature, prone to explosion) to withstand the impact of a plane and a massive fire?
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 1708 1831	A 45 degree angle cut only really makes sense on a vertical support, so how did they attach thermite to a vertical support?
T17	Value 1832 1911	Even nano-thermite takes considerable time to burn through a support that thick
T18	Value 1916 2033	whatever you're using to attach the thermite is just going to burn and fall off long before the I-beam is cut through
T19	Value 2189 2316	this was probably the result of debris falling down an elevator shaft or something similar, but I've got a more important point
T20	Rhetorical_Statement 2319 2348	What would these noises mean?
T21	Value 2349 2460	The buildings toppled from the top down and once the collapse started, Atlas himself couldn't hold that shit up
T22	Value 2530 2660	A building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum
T23	Rhetorical_Statement 2692 2741	how could they have possibly gotten away with it?
T24	Rhetorical_Statement 2744 2856	Breaking the story would make you a national hero and celebrity, so how much money would it take to buy you off?
T25	Rhetorical_Statement 2861 2944	take that amount and multiply it by the number of people that had to be accomplices
T26	Rhetorical_Statement 2946 3194	Dozens of demolitions *experts* (and I mean they have to have a demolition superpower to pull off this job), Security and Janitorial staff that took a bribe to effectively let their friends/coworkers die, guys willing to kill themselves for the job
T27	Rhetorical_Statement 3196 3349	Add onto that all the people that found out working on the official report of what happened and every guy at Popular Mechanic that learned the dark truth
T28	Rhetorical_Statement 3352 3396	And every single one of them took the bribe?
T29	Rhetorical_Statement 3397 3475	Not only did they take the bribe, but none of them have come out about it yet?
T30	Value 3476 3654	The NSA couldn't even get away with it's spying operation when it wasn't hurting anybody and had noble intentions (wrong and an invasion of privacy, but still...noble intentions)
T31	Rhetorical_Statement 3660 3729	you think that a group could get away with murdering 5,000 civilians?
T32	Value 3730 3790	The first person to come out would be a celebrity and a hero
T33	Value 3792 3877	He'd be on talk shows, have book and movie deals, and get his name written in history
T34	Rhetorical_Statement 3879 3925	But not a single person is willing to do that?
T35	Value 3927 4087	To propose that 9/11 was an inside job raises so many questions, and I can practically guaranty any answers you give are just going to raise even more questions

&gt; BUILDING 7

What exactly was the benefit of these unknown insiders destroying building 7? It accomplished nothing compared to the Twin Towers and Pentagon in terms of boosting public support for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, so the only other theory I can think of was that there was some sensitive data stored there. In which case, wouldn't these "insiders" have a much easier job sneaking in and destroying the data rather than destroying the entire building?

&gt;The buildings all collapsed uniformly at near free fall speed 

The buildings fell at free fall speed because they were being piledriven by all the building on top of it. Think about how much weight was at and above where the two planes hit. How many tons of metal, concrete, etc. came down the minute the collapse started? That much weight is pretty much unstoppable.

&gt;implying a coordinated severance of support beams...

Have you seen the amount of wiring and explosives that normal demolitions companies use to destroy a building? How much time it takes to set that stuff up? How much more time it would take to set it all up but have it all be perfectly hidden? How could these "insiders" sneak into the building undetected by security personnel and janitorial staff and do all of this work? Work by the way that was **impossibly durable** because it all survived the impact of a jetliner and the subsequent fire.  How do you design a demolition project (which is by it's very nature, prone to explosion) to withstand the impact of a plane and a massive fire?

&gt;with pictures showing 45 degree angled cuts on support beams not consistent with melting the columns.

A 45 degree angle cut only really makes sense on a vertical support, so how did they attach thermite to a vertical support? Even nano-thermite takes considerable time to burn through a support that thick, so whatever you're using to attach the thermite is just going to burn and fall off long before the I-beam is cut through.

&gt;Multiple Eye-witness accounts of explosion coming from the basement and bottom floor, along with the janitor that was in basements burns.

I suspect this was probably the result of debris falling down an elevator shaft or something similar, but I've got a more important point:

What would these noises mean? The buildings toppled from the top down and once the collapse started, Atlas himself couldn't hold that shit up.

&gt;Traces of nano-thermite in the dust collected from the scene.

A building falling with such force pulverized almost everything in it's path, including rusty stuff and stuff made out of aluminum.


Here's the kicker though: **how could they have possibly gotten away with it?** Breaking the story would make you a national hero and celebrity, so how much money would it take to buy you off? Now take that amount and multiply it by the number of people that had to be accomplices. Dozens of demolitions *experts* (and I mean they have to have a demolition superpower to pull off this job), Security and Janitorial staff that took a bribe to effectively let their friends/coworkers die, guys willing to kill themselves for the job. Add onto that all the people that found out working on the official report of what happened and every guy at Popular Mechanic that learned the dark truth.

And every single one of them took the bribe? Not only did they take the bribe, but none of them have come out about it yet? The NSA couldn't even get away with it's spying operation when it wasn't hurting anybody and had noble intentions (wrong and an invasion of privacy, but still...noble intentions); but you think that a group could get away with murdering 5,000 civilians? The first person to come out would be a celebrity and a hero. He'd be on talk shows, have book and movie deals, and get his name written in history. But not a single person is willing to do that?

To propose that 9/11 was an inside job raises so many questions, and I can practically guaranty any answers you give are just going to raise even more questions.

op_title: I believe 9/11 was an inside job. CMV

1) ALL of the buildings in the complex were damaged by massive buildings falling on them, building 7 just got the worst of it. IIRC, building 7 fell about an hour after 1 and 2, and firefighters had already evacuated because they could tell it was on the verge of collapse.

2) If you watch video of the towers falling, you can see they started at where the planes hit. There were several stories above where the planes hit, so that's a lot of weight falling at once onto the rest of the building, which caused a chain reaction of each floor falling into the next. The building wasn't built for that kind of stress, which caused the whole thing to collapse pretty quickly. As far as the cut beams you were talking about, there were only a few of them, and truthers cherry picked them out.

3) When the towers fell, each floor sandwitched into the next. There's a lot of air in between each floor, and it has to go somewhere. the easiest escape out is weakened windows (the explosions coming out of windows some truthers like to point out) or down the stairwell, which ended in the basement. I never heard about a burned janitor, but that air coming into the basement would be really hot.

4) Thermite is just a mixture of a metal powder and a oxidizer, typically aluminum and iron oxide. You don't need a chemical reaction to make it, just to physically mix it (mythbusters made a bunch by putting the two powders in a cement mixer). You'd find a lot of that stuff mixed together when 2 100+ story buildings collapse.

In addition to that, an inside job would require weeks of work, including cutting away walls to wrap the support beams with explosives or thermite (which unless channeled, only burns down btw). Many of the over 30,000 people that worked there every day must have noticed that, but no one did.

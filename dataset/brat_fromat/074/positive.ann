T1	Value 62 184	ALL of the buildings in the complex were damaged by massive buildings falling on them, building 7 just got the worst of it
T2	Fact 192 275	building 7 fell about an hour after 1 and 2, and firefighters had already evacuated
T3	Value 284 331	they could tell it was on the verge of collapse
T4	Value 337 427	If you watch video of the towers falling, you can see they started at where the planes hit
T5	Fact 429 482	There were several stories above where the planes hit
T6	Value 487 622	that's a lot of weight falling at once onto the rest of the building, which caused a chain reaction of each floor falling into the next
T7	Value 624 730	The building wasn't built for that kind of stress, which caused the whole thing to collapse pretty quickly
T8	Value 732 846	As far as the cut beams you were talking about, there were only a few of them, and truthers cherry picked them out
T9	Fact 852 910	When the towers fell, each floor sandwitched into the next
T10	Value 912 954	There's a lot of air in between each floor
T11	Value 960 982	it has to go somewhere
T12	Value 984 1148	the easiest escape out is weakened windows (the explosions coming out of windows some truthers like to point out) or down the stairwell, which ended in the basement
T13	Value 1150 1245	I never heard about a burned janitor, but that air coming into the basement would be really hot
T14	Fact 1251 1345	Thermite is just a mixture of a metal powder and a oxidizer, typically aluminum and iron oxide
T15	Fact 1347 1419	You don't need a chemical reaction to make it, just to physically mix it
T16	Fact 1421 1490	mythbusters made a bunch by putting the two powders in a cement mixer
T17	Value 1493 1575	You'd find a lot of that stuff mixed together when 2 100+ story buildings collapse
T18	Value 1599 1770	an inside job would require weeks of work, including cutting away walls to wrap the support beams with explosives or thermite (which unless channeled, only burns down btw)
T19	Value 1772 1853	Many of the over 30,000 people that worked there every day must have noticed that
T20	Fact 1859 1869	no one did

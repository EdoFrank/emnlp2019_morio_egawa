op_title: I think that diamond engagement rings are a sham. CMV

First off, a bit about me. I'm a young male, I don't want to get married yet, but would like to some day. I also don't want a big wedding, or to have children, so I guess you could say that i'm not very traditional. I have no problem buying a plain ring or a ring with an alternative to diamonds, as long as it's under a couple of hundred euros.

The main reason I don't want to buy an engagement ring is money. They are ridiculusly overpriced. I'm not willing to pay a couple of grand for a shiny rock. I think the money could be much better spent on a a great holiday, or to help start your married life together. 

Also, I think that diamonds are a sham. They aren't rare, they are just strategically kept out of the market. I think that people are brainwashed into thinking that this is a symbol of love. That your prospective life partner doesn't think you're worth it, if they don't buy you a shiny rock. This materialistic urge that is drilled into people fom a young age, by people who stand to profit from it, is something I don't buy into, and don't want to comply with or encourage. 

I want my view changed because all the women in my family disagree with me, and i'm 
worried about it leading to relationship problems down the line.

Edit: My view has been partially changed in some ways. I can now see some merit in certain people buying diamonds. Alas my core beliefs on the subject stil hold firm.
Thank you to everyone who commented. I didn't expect this to get as much attention as it had and i've thuroughly enjoyed this discussion.

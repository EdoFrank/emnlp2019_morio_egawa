T1	Testimony 87 137	I never thought I wanted a diamond engagement ring
T2	Testimony 139 238	When my then-girlfriend was considered proposing, she asked me what I wanted and what I cared about
T3	Testimony 240 277	The proposal itself had been expected
T4	Testimony 283 358	I told her at the time I didn't know what I wanted and would need some time
T5	Testimony 361 417	She hated the idea of me not having something 'concrete'
T6	Testimony 422 522	we spent some time shopping around and finally found a Swarovski ring with the features that I liked
T7	Testimony 524 572	It cost us around 150USD, and I wear it everyday
T8	Testimony 574 667	It's much brighter than the diamond jewelry that I own, which were handmedowns from my mother
T9	Value 669 791	The problem is, even though it's brighter, it is not intended for everyday wear the same way a traditional diamond ring is
T10	Value 795 903	Engagement and wedding rings, by their very nature, are crafted to be durable and beautiful at the same time
T11	Testimony 905 1031	My mother's wedding set was worn every day for 35 years before she passed away, and the ring itself was never dented or dinged
T12	Testimony 1033 1307	My ring, in comparison, shows obvious wear: the coating has chipped on the bottom from where it scratches against various surfaces, the small jewels on the band have fallen out (they've been replaced now, thankfully), and I have to polish it more often to retain the sparkle
T13	Value 1311 1444	While the concept of a diamond ring as a necessary gift for an engagement was certainly engineered by DeBeers as a marketing campaign
T14	Value 1446 1489	there's nothing *wrong* with wanting a ring
T15	Value 1500 1596	a diamond ring is a tasteful, tangible way to display my love for my partner (and theirs for me)
T16	Value 1604 1669	I personally wouldn't opt for a larger than life multi-carat ring
T17	Value 1671 1761	I don't think there's anything wrong with someone whose taste leads them in that direction
T18	Value 1764 1816	When I do buy a ring, I know I'll buy a diamond ring
T19	Value 1818 1943	I won't be thrilled about the cost, but I also wasn't thrilled about buying a new car, or the cost to move across the country
T20	Value 1949 2074	I know that every day that I look at it, I'll be reminded of the love and sacrifice my SO and I shared, and I won't regret it

T1	Testimony 75 170	This is pretty much the way I thought for a long time until I got my fiancée an engagement ring
T2	Testimony 173 268	After doing lots of research I am extremely happy with my purchase of a diamond engagement ring
T3	Fact 533 589	the big cartel player (De Beers) has finally been broken
T4	Fact 592 774	In 2000 producers in Russia, Canada and Australia decided to cut off channels to De Beers due to the negative publicity of “blood diamonds”  and De Beers has been losing market share

T8	Value 1010 1101	You could argue at this point in 2013, there is no manipulation and it is simply the market
T9	Value 1109 1167	You’re not buying the rough diamond, you’re buying the art
T10	Value 1170 1192	Diamonds are expensive
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1195 1273	I mean wtf they are just shiny hard pieces of carbon, I mean hell so is my ass
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1276 1305	So why are they so expensive?
T13	Value 1307 1381	It’s because of the art and skill it takes to cut a polish a rough diamond
T14	Value 1384 1516	These are skilled professionals who take years of training and experience to cut a rough diamond and actually make it look fantastic
T15	Value 1519 1629	Cut, the most important quality in my opinion, is almost entirely dependent on the skill of the diamond cutter
T16	Value 1636 1706	even the carat is dependent on the diamond cutter not cutting too much
T17	Value 1738 1760	no diamond is the same
T18	Value 1763 1796	That may sound lame but it’s true
T19	Value 1799 1919	Small differences in facet pattern can produce large differences in the pattern of light that is reflected off the stone

T24	Rhetorical_Statement 2187 2306	if we stay together for 50 years (perfectly reasonable considering our age) this means that the per day usage is $0.27!
T25	Rhetorical_Statement 2362 2472	you still may not like a mined diamond who knows maybe the store or website is lying and it is a blood diamond
T26	Testimony 2475 2560	I considered buying a synthetic diamond from a place like [here](http://gemesis.com/)
T27	Fact 2563 2650	They use large pressure cookers to form real diamonds which are a little less expensive
T28	Testimony 2653 2675	I didn’t buy from them
T29	Testimony 2684 2797	they didn’t have the shape and style I was looking for and they aren’t that great at producing pure colorless yet
T30	Value 2804 2847	they appear to be getting better and better
T31	Value 2860 2909	they are about the same price for freaking carbon
T32	Fact 2930 3014	these diamonds still need to be cut by the same artists who cut earth-grown diamonds
T33	Value 3050 3105	the technology needed to make these is an art in itself
T34	Value 3114 3170	You get enjoyment researching and every day she wears it
T35	Testimony 3181 3267	it was fun looking all this up knowing that she will wear what I pick every single day
T36	Testimony 3270 3417	Sometimes I see the sparkle of the facet pattern when we are out at a restaurant and think of how I may know the facet pattern better than she does

T38	Testimony 3531 3635	Sometimes while driving her I see some shimmer on the celling of the car and think about what that means
T39	Testimony 3637 3899	this stone, this diamond, on my fiancée’s finger, grew in the earth for perhaps millions of years at 1800 degrees to one day be blasted out of the earth through a volcano, to then be found, mined, cut, polished and finally purchased by me and given to my fiancée
T40	Testimony 3902 4090	Sometimes while on the couch with her, I see some reflection on the wall and I think of the sacrifice it took to mine, produce, and ship and the cost to me and I think that she is worth it
T41	Value 4096 4197	You get to be reminded almost every day what this person means to you and at $0.27 a day it’s a steal

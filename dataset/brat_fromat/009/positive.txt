A benefit you're missing: (Or, alternately, a cost to having the religious symbols): The symbols placed there/supported by gov't are alienating those that don't share those beliefs, especially if the gov't says "yes, religion X can have its symbols there, but not religion Y, and definitely none for atheists"

A school that emphasizes that it's "one nation under god" is telling non religious (or, say, polytheistic students) "you're a second class person here. This is one nation under _GOD_, and you're an unamerican poopyhead if you don't accept The One God"

That's a nontrivial cost indeed. Further, it tells _others_ that it's okay to alienate those people.

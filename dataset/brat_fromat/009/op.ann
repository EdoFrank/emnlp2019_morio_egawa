T1	Major_Claim 19 114	I absolutely despise atheist organizations that attempt to remove public religious symbols. CMV
T2	Value 116 159	For me, it's a simple cost-benefit analysis
T3	Value 173 322	Arguably upholding the constitution (letter of the law which no one really cares about, and doesn't affect any individual's rights or group's rights)
T4	Value 332 426	They manage to severely piss off, alienate, unify, and reinforce religious people against them
T5	Value 429 494	They give atheists a bad name, and come across as fundamentalists
T6	Value 497 631	They waste precious resources (money, time, and manpower) that could have been used for causes that actually do something for humanity
T7	Value 633 672	This is all a matter of crocodile tears
T8	Value 674 794	Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone
T9	Value 796 867	The vast majority of people are not ready to be weaned off religion yet
T10	Value 873 942	forcing them off the teat in a publicly militant fashion helps no one
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 949 1164	if it's about indoctrination, do you seriously think that the beliefs of kids raised by atheists who are taught to question everything would actually be changed by the insertion of God into the pledge of allegiance?

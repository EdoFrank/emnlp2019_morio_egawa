op_title: I absolutely despise atheist organizations that attempt to remove public religious symbols. CMV

For me, it's a simple cost-benefit analysis:

Benefit:

-Arguably upholding the constitution (letter of the law which no one really cares about, and doesn't affect any individual's rights or group's rights)

Cost:

-They manage to severely piss off, alienate, unify, and reinforce religious people against them

-They give atheists a bad name, and come across as fundamentalists

-They waste precious resources (money, time, and manpower) that could have been used for causes that actually do something for humanity

This is all a matter of crocodile tears. Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone. The vast majority of people are not ready to be weaned off religion yet, and forcing them off the teat in a publicly militant fashion helps no one.

And if it's about indoctrination, do you seriously think that the beliefs of kids raised by atheists who are taught to question everything would actually be changed by the insertion of God into the pledge of allegiance? Please...

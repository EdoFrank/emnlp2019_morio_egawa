op_title: I absolutely despise atheist organizations that attempt to remove public religious symbols. CMV

&gt;Public religious symbols, along with God's name on currency and in the pledge of allegiance, don't do any harm to anyone.

Public religious symbols can mislead religious people, who have the ability to influence public policy, about the separation of church and state. Many times I've heard the argument that this is a Christian nation, and that it was founded on Christian values to push policies that violate this separation.

Also, if you can understand why it would bother religious people so much to remove those symbols, is it so hard to understand why some atheists would be bothered by their presence?

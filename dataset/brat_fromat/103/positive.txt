op_title: I don't believe that the military should have different fitness standards for men and women. CMV

As we all know, military jobs often require no physical activity at all. If a particular military job involves a great deal of physical activity, the standards will be much higher. In general though, they want healthy, disciplined, physically fit people to be in the military, and the requirements are meant to exclude people who are not those things. Generally speaking, a man requires a much lower level of health, discipline, and fitness in order to reach the womens' standards than a woman does. The standards are just a proxy for "in shape," and are in no way intended as a test of functional ability other than in the absolute broadest sense.

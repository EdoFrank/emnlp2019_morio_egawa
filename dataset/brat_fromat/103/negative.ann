T1	Value 134 160	this rubs people's hackles
T2	Value 169 232	the brain easily confuses fitness standards with military might
T3	Value 272 327	Fitness standards are a basic notion of overall fitness
T4	Value 329 504	It perhaps at one point was something similar to the idea of firefighters, that any one firefighter, if called upon, could pull any other firefighter out of a burning building
T5	Value 506 701	It stands to reason then, that you would want to make the basic standards for a firefighter to be able to lift and carry 250 pounds (the most likely weight a firefighter and his gear would weight
T6	Value 708 891	in todays ever changing military, it is simply not necessary, nor is it wise to operate under the idea that any soldier at any moment could and would need to take the place of another
T7	Value 893 993	Psychological operations, networking, drones, smart-war tactics require much more variety in ability
T8	Value 995 1064	This level of functional differentiation requires different skillsets
T9	Value 1066 1295	In the same way that we acknowledge that the Air Force requires more technical knowhow, we see different standards for physical fitness in the Air Force as we see in the Marines, where brute physical skill is more often necessary
T10	Value 1317 1431	adding the diversity of ideas is one of the things that makes this country great, and our military is no exception
T11	Value 1433 1611	Similar to the idea that female police officers radically changed notions of interrogation with detectives and brought a fresh, nuanced perspective to the craft of detective work
T12	Value 1618 1819	for the same reason that you shouldn't be alarmed that a long distance runner would be a terrible strongman, so should you not be concerned about the fitness standards being different for men and women
T13	Value 1821 1916	The only thing that is important is that women remain physically fit within their ability level
T14	Value 1926 2021	their mind will be kept sharp (the point of fitness) and their body ready to react with purpose
T15	Value 2023 2236	Our military will always have plenty of strong men to do what strong men are called upon for, and having a diversity of skillsets and ideas that women will bring will only enhance our military might, not weaken it

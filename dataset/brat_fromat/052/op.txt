op_title: I belive AA is only a temporary solution for alcholics. Not a healthy long term solution to treat addiction. CMV

I came across this today on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1h6tb5/til_bill_wilson_the_well_known_cofounder_of/) . 
While most of the comments sympathize with giving the guy a damn drink, I find it very disappointing that a person dedicated to help alcohol addicts broke down and caved into his problem. This is usually what happens to these people who devote their entire lives to AA meetings and then all of a sudden stop. I've known people who are in AA. Someone in particular who has been going to meetings for 20 years once downright told me if she stopped, then she would go into a downhill spiral of abuse. The program to me seems that it strips away your will and makes people rely on dependence of being addicted to this program instead of alcohol. The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need. However, it's not something that I believe is a healthy way to quit and stay sober.
Also on a different note, for Non-Christians it can be very awkward because of the heavy influence god has on meetings.

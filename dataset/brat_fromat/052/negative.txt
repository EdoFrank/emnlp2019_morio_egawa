I'm just going to go ahead and point out that your argument a) is unsupported by any statistical evidence about the efficacy of AA and b) turns on your notion of what constitutes "healthy" and "long term," two things which you haven't defined. What to you is a "healthy" way to deal with alcoholism, and how is it more "healthy" to simply remain a practicing alcoholic when your "healthy" prescription doesn't pan out for someone? How long is "long term?"

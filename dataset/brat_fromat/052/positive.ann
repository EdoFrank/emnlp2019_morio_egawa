T1	Testimony 134 204	As a recovering alcoholic, I hope I can shed some light on the subject
T2	Value 208 281	It's not uncommon to run into what they call "dry drunks" in the meetings
T3	Value 283 441	People who have essentially replaced one addiction with another, albeit a much healthier one (being "addicted" to being in AA vs. being addicted to the drink)
T4	Fact 443 521	One of the main tenets of any 12-step program is the need for character change
T5	Testimony 523 626	I find the program, at times, to rely heavily on semantics, and I don't live my life by all their rules
T6	Testimony 628 716	I have, however, found a lot of help and wisdom and insight from the people in the rooms
T7	Testimony 718 866	There was an episode of Elementary where he says something like (I'm paraphrasing), "I don't mistake the ethos of the program for a guide to living"
T8	Value 988 1069	As a recovering alcoholic, I feel that you are grossly misinformed with this line
T9	Value 1071 1086	This isn't true
T10	Testimony 1088 1164	The urges, for me, and I can *only* speak for me, subsided greatly over time
T11	Testimony 1166 1213	I don't wake up thinking about drinking anymore
T12	Testimony 1215 1255	Some days, I don't think about it at all
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1257 1276	Most days, actually
T14	Testimony 1282 1361	when I do, like right now, I can remove myself emotionally from wanting a drink
T15	Testimony 1363 1379	I don't want one
T16	Testimony 1381 1408	It all comes down to choice
T17	Value 1462 1547	it leads me to believe that people don't have a clear understanding of the AA Program
T18	Value 1549 1624	It clearly states, and I agree, that willpower will not work for the addict
T19	Testimony 1626 1715	I had to get to a point where I didn't WANT to drink, just like I no longer want to smoke
T20	Value 1717 1765	It's not me depriving myself of something I want
T21	Value 1767 1824	It's me living a better, cleaner, happier, healthier life
T22	Testimony 1963 1994	I see these people all the time
T23	Value 2013 2041	they're not doing it "right"
T24	Testimony 2043 2129	I don't feel helpless without the program and I don't feel like I lack control *TODAY*
T25	Testimony 2135 2215	if I had a drink, any drink, at any time, I do doubt my ability to stop drinking
T26	Value 2217 2280	I don't want to get into the notion of the disease of addiction
T27	Testimony 2302 2353	once I start drinking, I'm damn near powerless stop
T28	Value 2364 2468	this is where I disagree with the program, at least semantically, only I can have the power to not drink
T29	Value 2470 2486	I make that call
T30	Rhetorical_Statement 2488 2540	No one holds a gun to my head and forces me to drink
T31	Value 2542 2556	It's my choice
T32	Value 2558 2592	It ALL comes down to choice for me
T33	Testimony 2596 2674	I'm a non-Christian and, I'm not gonna lie, some meetings get really god-heavy
T34	Value 2706 2795	I don't know everything, and that a Higher Power can simply mean something bigger than me
T35	Testimony 2797 2911	When I went to rehab, angry and bitter and knowing everything, I made a friend who was a pretty hardcore Christian
T36	Testimony 2913 3051	She knew I didn't believe in god, and on our last day she made me a card that said "It's important to believe in something bigger than us"
T37	Testimony 3057 3142	on the inside there was a picture of an elephant and it read "I believe in elephants"
T38	Value 3144 3173	That was my jumping-off point
T39	Value 3177 3220	The mind of an addict is tricky and twisted
T40	Value 3222 3328	AA, and other programs, give the addict the ability to sort that shit out in a safe, welcoming environment
T41	Rhetorical_Statement 3330 3355	Did I work all the steps?
T42	Rhetorical_Statement 3356 3358	No
T43	Value 3364 3391	I don't know if I ever will
T44	Testimony 3397 3537	I learned coping mechanisms and insights into myself and the world around me that have allowed me to keep feeding the good wolf, as they say
T45	Value 3539 3612	There are Cognitive Behavioural Therapy sessions and tools that also work
T46	Value 3618 3648	we can't put everyone in a box
T47	Value 3650 3688	AA works for someone who wants it work
T48	Value 3690 3735	Who embraces that it does come down to choice
T49	Value 3737 3790	I can't say AA is the only thing that's kept me sober
T50	Value 3796 3813	it's helped a lot
T51	Value 3979 4037	In my mind, and the mind of many addicts, there is no cure
T52	Value 4039 4086	It can be arrested, but it will always be there
T53	Value 4088 4116	I will be an addict for life
T54	Value 4118 4159	It's not something I believe can be cured
T55	Rhetorical_Statement 4161 4173	Just treated

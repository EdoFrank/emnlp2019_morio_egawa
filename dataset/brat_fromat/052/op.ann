T1	Major_Claim 20 132	I belive AA is only a temporary solution for alcholics. Not a healthy long term solution to treat addiction. CMV
T2	Testimony 134 270	I came across this today on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1h6tb5/til_bill_wilson_the_well_known_cofounder_of/)
T3	Value 274 460	While most of the comments sympathize with giving the guy a damn drink, I find it very disappointing that a person dedicated to help alcohol addicts broke down and caved into his problem
T4	Value 462 581	This is usually what happens to these people who devote their entire lives to AA meetings and then all of a sudden stop
T5	Testimony 583 614	I've known people who are in AA
T6	Testimony 616 770	Someone in particular who has been going to meetings for 20 years once downright told me if she stopped, then she would go into a downhill spiral of abuse
T7	Value 772 914	The program to me seems that it strips away your will and makes people rely on dependence of being addicted to this program instead of alcohol
T8	Value 916 1026	The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit
T9	Value 1028 1156	Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program
T10	Value 1158 1254	This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need
T11	Value 1265 1338	it's not something that I believe is a healthy way to quit and stay sober
T12	Value 1366 1458	for Non-Christians it can be very awkward because of the heavy influence god has on meetings

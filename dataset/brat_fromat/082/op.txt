Tax-deductable charitable donations in the U.S. include giving to any one of a very broad spectrum of organizations.  The missions of these organizations range from eradicating malaria and polio to funding the opera.  Most charitable giving is unfortunately not anything near the best use of charitable funds to improve the lives of others.  Causes are chosen selfishly by the donor, so it is really a form of glorified luxury spending.


Around the world, it is surprisingly cheap to save a life.  Give Well, a charity evaluation group which conducts independant research, uses $3,000 per life saved as a basic criteria for cost-effective charitable impact (http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/criteria/cost-effectiveness).  Top groups clear this hurdle comfortably.  According to Give Well, the Against Malaria Foundation has saved one child life for every $2,500 it has been given, and can save one additional life for every futures $2,300 donation due to the savings it has achieved at a larger scale.


Here is a breakdown of U.S. charitable donations in 2011: http://www.nps.gov/partnerships/fundraising_individuals_statistics.htm.  Of the $300 billion donated, 32% went to religious groups, 13% went to colleges and universities for education, gifts to foundations were 10%, support for arts/culture/humanities were 4%, and 3% of funds were unallocated (including carryover tax benefits and donations to government agencies).  The combined total of this donation is 62% of U.S. giving, a healthy majority.  


Lets just take the 4% spent on the arts as a starting point.  That is $13.12 billion dollars.  Donated to the most cost-effective global charities, using the $3,000 per life measure, this money could be expected to save about 4 million lives.  But in the U.S., we use it to pay for very talented classical musicians, visual artists, and poets to entertain the wealthy elite.


Or take the college and university component.  The average cost of one year of undergraduate education is over $20,000 at public colleges, and over $50,000 and private colleges (which receive a disproportionate share of donations) (source: http://scholarships.com/resources/campus-life/college-costs/).  Lets charitably assume that donations to universities actually go 100% to the core purpose of universities, and never get spent on things like athletics or fundraising costs or building gaudy structures etc.  Even if that's the case, and even using $20k/year for 4 years as the cost of a college degree, every college education that these donations pay for costs the lives of about 22 people, who could have been saved by a cost-efficient use of that donation money.


So how do I feel about fancy billionaires like T Boone Pickens, who donate tens millions to a unversity's football program and get rewarded with tax deductions and their name on buildings?  Or ambitious social givers who spend $1000/plate on a fundraising dinner for their local opera?  You can guess.  Should I feel much better about the people who donate to U.S. medical causes which are maybe about 1/10th as cost effective as groups like AMF?  Those causes are only 10% less wasteful than a giant donation to a college football team.  


So Reddit, Change My View.  Convince me of any of the following:

(1)  Most donations in the U.S. go to relatively cost-effective groups.

(2)  Donations that go to grossly inefficient groups are still admirable charity and not just objectively inferior to cost-effective life-savers (note that I and Give Well both would try to give proportional credit to non-life-saving interventions like curing disability and chronic disease, etc).

(3)  Most donors are really trying to give to the best causes, not just selecting causes based on who has the coolest fundraising events, who is socially trendy, what improves life in their backyard instead of in some far-flung third world country, whose fundraising efforts have been most aggressive in targetting them, etc.

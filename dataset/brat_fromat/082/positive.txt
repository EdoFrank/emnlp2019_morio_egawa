You can save a life for $2500 today, but that doesn't guarantee that any people are saved in the long term. Donations to save Rwandans from malaria in 1990 were not as effective as they seemed, especially considering that the ensuing slaughter seems to have had as much to do with overpopulation as with ethnicity. 

A $2500 donation to physics research at a state college won't save any lives in the short term, but it will rachet humanity ahead in a way that is much harder to undo than increasing the population of an impoverished country. And if there is a better state of society ahead of us, then by shifting us toward it, this donation may save more than one life.

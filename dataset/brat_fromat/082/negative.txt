To this I would mention many many people donate to what emotionally impacts the donator.  What if an underprivileged youth was granted the opportunity to see an opera, go to an otherwise unaffordable museum, or given the opportunity to go to college and this opportunity changed that persons life in such a way that they became hugely successful?  Because of what helped them, the donator is going to support the organization that supported him/her.

Basically, you are ignoring any possible emotional connection any donor may or may not have, which is to say most donors are really trying to give to the best causes.  It just happens that not everyone agrees on what the best causes are.  People are naturally going to give back to the organizations that helped them the most; in their eyes it is the best possible use for their charitable donation.

Another thing to note: while plenty of people have pointed out that saving lives is not the only measure the effectiveness or worthiness of a charity, but I have yet to see anything that mentions fringe benefits (and a "fringe benefit" could be saving live).  Who is to say that an underprivileged youth that received a life changing experience would not have otherwise become a murderer or some other detriment to society?  Obviously complete speculation but I do think that it is worthy of note that these donations to universities, arts programs, and other "non life-saving" charities could, in fact, save many lives.

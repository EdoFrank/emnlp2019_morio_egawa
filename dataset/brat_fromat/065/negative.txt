op_title: I believe it is wrong to push your morals on someone else CMV.

I definitely agree it would be wrong to push the more personal morals you seem to be talking about on someone through force or social pressure, but surely I should be allowed to push my morals through argument? If instead of saying "I am right, you are wrong, change," I say "I am right, you are wrong, for reasons X, Y and Z" is that still wrong? Absolute certainty is also to high of a standard to expect people to have before acting on their beliefs.

I also am wondering if you include things like evangelism and vegetarian in your list of morals that should not be pushed?

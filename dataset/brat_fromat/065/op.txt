op_title: I believe it is wrong to push your morals on someone else CMV.

The only moral that I have ever tried to press on others is not to press your morals on others. A contradiction, I know, but a necessary one. I have always held the belief that I am intrinsically incapable of determining whether or not my own opinions are indeed the correct opinions to have. I simply cant, with any factual evidence tell you that I am morally superior. The only thing that I can, with absolute certainty, tell you; is that I lack to capability to be absolutely certain of anything. Which means neither can you, or anyone else alive for that matter. We are all painfully unknowing. To look at the morals of someone else and say "I am right, you are wrong, change," is suggesting at the most basic level that you are certain that you are correct and superior, which you are intrinsically not. In doing this you elevate yourself to a level that god may not even occupy which, to me, is quite unsavory.

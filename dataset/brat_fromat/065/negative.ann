T1	Value 103 226	it would be wrong to push the more personal morals you seem to be talking about on someone through force or social pressure
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 232 294	surely I should be allowed to push my morals through argument?
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 295 431	If instead of saying "I am right, you are wrong, change," I say "I am right, you are wrong, for reasons X, Y and Z" is that still wrong?
T4	Value 432 536	Absolute certainty is also to high of a standard to expect people to have before acting on their beliefs
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 539 661	I also am wondering if you include things like evangelism and vegetarian in your list of morals that should not be pushed?

T1	Major_Claim 20 186	I think classes for "gifted" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV
T2	Testimony 188 340	My middle school had GATE, Gifted And Talented Education, to provide "gifted" kids with extra enrichment so that they could reach their "full potential"
T3	Testimony 342 533	The students in the gifted classes often got more attention from teachers than other students, even if those "regular" students were just as smart as - if not smarter than - the "gifted" ones
T4	Value 549 612	if the kids are really "gifted", they shouldn't need extra help
T5	Policy 618 740	those "enrichment" classes should be given to struggling students who would benefit more from the extra work and attention
T6	Value 760 899	stratifying students in this way causes unnecessary self-esteem issues to students who are deemed "not smart enough" for the gifted classes
T7	Policy 927 1012	such classes should be offered for struggling students instead, or not offered at all

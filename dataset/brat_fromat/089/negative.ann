T1	Value 188 265	I'm not sure I understand, but what I think you are saying is quite offensive
T2	Value 270 307	Maybe I am misunderstanding something
T3	Value 312 462	GATE has nothing to do with struggling students, it's for the kids who are able to learn faster or at a higher level than the average kids around them
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 465 553	What does that have to do with kids who are having trouble learning the normal material?
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 555 749	Are you saying we should stop encouraging kids to learn as much as possible and just treat the smart kids like normal kids and hinder their development purely so we don't hurt someones feelings?
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 751 896	I'm sorry if your kid has less potential than mine, but why does that mean my child who is above average should not be able to learn at his rate?
T7	Value 898 944	Special-Ed classes help the kids below average
T8	Value 947 987	Gate classes help the kids above average
T9	Value 1000 1037	we can't teach every kid individually
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 1043 1144	why not at least have some sort of distinction so that each kid is more likely to reach his potential
T11	Value 1147 1252	By your reasoning we should put all kids in the special-ed classes just so we don't hurt anyones feelings
T12	Value 1255 1295	That's how absurd your post sounds to me
T13	Value 1344 1531	I just feel offended that someone actually think we should actively and directly hinder a kids potential just for the sake of someone potentially feeling bad about not being above average

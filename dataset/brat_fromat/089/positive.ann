T1	Testimony 188 400	I was in GATE, and I have family members that were in special ed and an aunt that still assists with special ed (not just children with severe mental disabilities, but also just slow learners) children in schools
T2	Value 403 507	For one, GATE classes are *slightly* harder, but at an accelerated pace as to cover more during the year
T3	Value 509 530	That's the difference
T4	Testimony 532 703	We didn't have more time in our GATE classes, the teacher didn't spend more time with us, it was just accelerated learning for the kids who caught onto the material faster
T5	Testimony 706 825	As for resources going towards GATE and not to other struggling children, we didn't get any more than other classes did
T6	Value 827 905	It was just another class with a label on it that learned at a different speed
T7	Value 907 1040	Just like special ed classes for the mentally handicapped, it was just a label put on a class of kids that learn at a different speed
T8	Value 1062 1101	special needs receive much more funding
T9	Testimony 1103 1195	My aunt is paid to shadow specific children throughout their day and assist them with school
T10	Testimony 1305 1331	We didn't get that in GATE
T11	Value 1334 1531	There's also all kinds of remedial classes, tutoring programs, teachers that have specific days to stay behind for after school help, all kinds of resources a struggling child could use to catch up
T12	Value 1571 1652	we have many resources that aren't cash sinks to help struggling children already

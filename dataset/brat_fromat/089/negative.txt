op_title: I think classes for "gifted" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV

I'm not sure I understand, but what I think you are saying is quite offensive...  Maybe I am misunderstanding something...

GATE has nothing to do with struggling students, it's for the kids who are able to learn faster or at a higher level than the average kids around them.  What does that have to do with kids who are having trouble learning the normal material?

Are you saying we should stop encouraging kids to learn as much as possible and just treat the smart kids like normal kids and hinder their development purely so we don't hurt someones feelings?

I'm sorry if your kid has less potential than mine, but why does that mean my child who is above average should not be able to learn at his rate?

Special-Ed classes help the kids below average.  Gate classes help the kids above average.  Obviously we can't teach every kid individually, but why not at least have some sort of distinction so that each kid is more likely to reach his potential.

By your reasoning we should put all kids in the special-ed classes just so we don't hurt anyones feelings.  That's how absurd your post sounds to me.

I am sorry if my post feels a little hostile, I just feel offended that someone actually think we should actively and directly hinder a kids potential just for the sake of someone potentially feeling bad about not being above average.

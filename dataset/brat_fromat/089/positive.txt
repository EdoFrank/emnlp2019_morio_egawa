op_title: I think classes for "gifted" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV

I was in GATE, and I have family members that were in special ed and an aunt that still assists with special ed (not just children with severe mental disabilities, but also just slow learners) children in schools.

For one, GATE classes are *slightly* harder, but at an accelerated pace as to cover more during the year. That's the difference. We didn't have more time in our GATE classes, the teacher didn't spend more time with us, it was just accelerated learning for the kids who caught onto the material faster.

As for resources going towards GATE and not to other struggling children, we didn't get any more than other classes did. It was just another class with a label on it that learned at a different speed. Just like special ed classes for the mentally handicapped, it was just a label put on a class of kids that learn at a different speed. I'd even argue that special needs receive much more funding. My aunt is paid to shadow specific children throughout their day and assist them with school. That's it. A single person on the payroll assigned to different children throughout the years to help them. We didn't get that in GATE.

There's also all kinds of remedial classes, tutoring programs, teachers that have specific days to stay behind for after school help, all kinds of resources a struggling child could use to catch up.

I guess is what I'm trying to say is we have many resources that aren't cash sinks to help struggling children already.

edit: after re-reading this it seems a little jumbled. sorry, I'm half asleep still.

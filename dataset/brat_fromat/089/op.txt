op_title: I think classes for "gifted" kids (like GATE) meant to provide extra enrichment should instead be offered to struggling students who would benefit more from them. CMV

My middle school had GATE, Gifted And Talented Education, to provide "gifted" kids with extra enrichment so that they could reach their "full potential". The students in the gifted classes often got more attention from teachers than other students, even if those "regular" students were just as smart as - if not smarter than - the "gifted" ones. I think that, if the kids are really "gifted", they shouldn't need extra help, and those "enrichment" classes should be given to struggling students who would benefit more from the extra work and attention. I also think that stratifying students in this way causes unnecessary self-esteem issues to students who are deemed "not smart enough" for the gifted classes. Therefore, I believe that such classes should be offered for struggling students instead, or not offered at all.

op_title: I'm more comfortable pirating a famous band's music than I am pirating a small-time musician's. CMV

I don't always pirate music, but when I do, it's a famous band's music.  I'll tell you why.

I think that small-time musicians need my money more than famous musicians do.  I would feel much more guilty about pirating a local band's music than I would feel pirating, say, Billy Joel's music.  Billy Joel doesn't need my $1.29, whereas a local band would certainly need it in order to make a career out of music.  I'll much more willingly give my $1.29 to my friend's band than to Billy Joel.

TL;DR: Famous musicians don't need my money, so I pirate their music more than I pirate a local musician's music.

EDIT: I'm not saying, "Nobody should ever buy Billy Joel's music ever again," nor am I saying that I will never buy Billy Joel's music ever again.  I'm just saying that I would rather support local musicians rather than musicians who are already successful.  If I have $10, and I want my friend's album and Billy Joel's album, either of which would cost me all $10, I'm going to choose my friend over Billy Joel.

EDIT 2: I realize that pirating is wrong. However, the question was not "To Pirate or Not To Pirate?" That question was "Why Should I Feel Guiltier for Pirating a Big-Name's Work Over a Local Band's Work?"  In this scenario, I am already going to be pirating a song.  My CMV comes in when the choice of who to pirate from comes up.

EDIT 3: I feel guilt either way, but I feel much guiltier if I pirate from a local band, who depends on every sale.  If I'm pirating a song, it's very likely that I wasn't going to buy it in the first place.  So the artist isn't losing any money.  Or, what happens if they make a music video and put it up on Youtube?  If I just listen to it on Youtube, and I never buy it?  Should I still feel guilty over that?

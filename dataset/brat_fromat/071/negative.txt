The only part that I would argue with, is the EDIT 2 part about pirating being wrong. 

If you truly support artists in your best ability, and pirate the more successful ones, then I would say that your attitude is significantly MORE beneficial to the music industry than those who would pay for every download. 

If everyone would act like you, then music could be a lot more diverse, with a lot of the billions that are currently hoarded by a few celebrities, spent on funding the existence of much more niche artists. 

If people would have stopped paying Billy Joel after his first million, then the rest of the money could have been spent on hundreds of other niche artists also earning their first million, instead of giving Billy Joel hundreds of million and let other artists leave the industry.   

In fact, I think we are already going in that direction thanks to the Internet. The celebrities of the mid-20th century sold a lot more albums than any of the the current biggest hits, yet we have a lot more indies making a living than ever. 

 That's because when the Beatles were big, if you wanted to listen to them, you HAD TO buy an album, with few alternatives. Nowadays everyone feels entitled to listen to Gangnam Style on youtube, while the industry earns the same overall revenues, so apparently the money that Psy could have hoarded a few decades ago, is distributed between many smaller artists.

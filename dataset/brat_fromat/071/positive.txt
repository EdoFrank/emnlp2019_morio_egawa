I would argue that pirating a small artists music is quite often a good thing. The biggest problem that small groups is that the vast majority of them languish is obscurity. Typically a group will become successful after some lucky break which has typically come from record labels signing them. But now that lucky break could be their music going viral via piracy which can lead to success. Think of it this way, piracy can be free marketing for a group that is otherwise unknown.

If however your main point is that your money is better spent on a small artist, then you are probably right.

T1	Value 135 216	It is a pretty big deal that they can investigate U.S. citizens without a warrant
T2	Value 219 262	Everyone knew that the NSA had surveillance
T3	Value 264 474	what's unsettling is the realistic possibility of insufficient oversight of the program's usage, and the classification of the FISA court rulings which may have indicated the unconstitutionality of NSA projects
T4	Fact 531 728	Through one of the leaked papers we did not only receive information that the NSA was gathering private data, but also received information on which companies had agreed to be used for surveillance
T5	Value 731 918	While few terrorists would have used gmail and such before to discuss plans of attack, you can guarantee that with this leak gone public these potential sources of information will dry up
T6	Value 921 1166	I personally doubt such channels of communication would yield much useful information, and don't think this is a valid reason to keep the program secret, but cannot deny that this leak did make the NSA's job of stopping terrorism a little harder
T7	Fact 1172 1333	Snowden has not released all of the data he left the NSA with, and word has it he has distributed encrypted copies of the data as "insurance" should he disappear
T8	Value 1336 1390	The language used to describe Snowden is disconcerting
T9	Value 1396 1606	it is a legitimate concern that with him being in China/Russia that he may be forced to divulge potentially-damaging secrets to foreign powers especially with the implications of having an "insurance" data file
T10	Value 1609 1671	The reaction of my country to the leaks is very unsettling yes
T11	Value 1709 1940	Congress has handled the investigation of the NSA quite poorly with terrible attendance at the hearing, mixed messages regarding the actions of the NSA, and not divulging any additional concrete information to justify their actions
T12	Value 1951 2163	Snowden's revelations of a system which compromises all major tech companies, shares the data with various European nations, and can allow for warrant-less investigation of U.S. citizens is pretty damn unsettling

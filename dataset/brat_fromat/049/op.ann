T3	Value 210 306	they are reserving the right and ability to spy on me without my knowing they have that capacity
T4	Value 309 333	I don't like this at all
T5	Value 344 373	I'm not really that surprised
T6	Value 384 411	it is absolutely terrifying
T7	Value 432 480	they tried to keep something so obvious a secret
T8	Value 483 510	I don't even understand why

T10	Value 587 620	they are so pissed off at Snowden
T11	Value 631 660	he did break the law, bigtime
T12	Value 666 756	you have to be a real cunt to chase the guy who spilled the beans on such an awful program

op_title: I think the US reaction to Snowden's leaks is far more unsettling than the information those leaks contained. CMV

Big fucking deal: the NSA tracks my phone and email records.  Technically, they are reserving the right and ability to spy on me without my knowing they have that capacity.  I don't like this at all, but TBH, I'm not really that surprised.  I think it is absolutely terrifying, however, that:

1. they tried to keep something so obvious a secret.  I don't even understand why.  it's not like public review of this program would even compromise it.

2. they are so pissed off at Snowden.  I guess he did break the law, bigtime, but you have to be a real cunt to chase the guy who spilled the beans on such an awful program.

EDIT:  After reading these replies, my opinion generally stands.  To wit--duh, they were checking out suspected terrorists' communicaitons; lame that they didn't use a warrant; the beef with Snowden is based more on embarrassment than an actual crime against our country--even if snowden did break the law.

EDIT 2: Lots of people are referring to nasty wasty stuff that snowden hasn't leaked yet.  That is possible, but based on these comments, seems speculative.  Top voted comment to give me credible reason to believe Snowden really has some nasty wasty shit gets a delta (note: this is legit use of delta.  seeing *credible* info would have significant impact on my opinion).

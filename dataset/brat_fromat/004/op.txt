op_title: I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society. CMV

I am a senior in high school, and while I dont cheat, I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it. I live in California, and the kids at my school take 5-6 AP classes junior year and senior year. They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes, and other resources like this. 

When every kid at your school is so far ahead, an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up. So they might resort to cheating to keep up with them. And I feel that this is justified because it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B, only to have their application to a better college rejected because people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule. 

So when it comes down to it in my opinion, when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face, cheating is justified. 

thanks in advance for your replies! 

Edit: I also just realized that this may seem an immature position because I'm a high school senior-but I hope to get some good discussion about this! Thanks again

T1	Major_Claim 19 218	I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society. CMV
T2	Value 220 342	I am a senior in high school, and while I dont cheat, I can see why people do it and I don't really have a problem with it
T3	Testimony 344 439	I live in California, and the kids at my school take 5-6 AP classes junior year and senior year
T4	Value 441 524	They pay large amounts of money for SAT prep classes, and other resources like this
T5	Value 528 652	When every kid at your school is so far ahead, an average student who works hard to get B's is left behind and can't keep up
T6	Value 657 707	they might resort to cheating to keep up with them
T7	Value 725 742	this is justified
T8	Value 751 884	it can be really unfair for those who work their asses off to get that B, only to have their application to a better college rejected
T9	Value 893 983	people keep pushing this envelope of cramming more and more AP classes into their schedule
T10	Value 990 1159	when it comes down to it in my opinion, when someone's hardest and best effort wont get them somewhere because of the unfair competition they face, cheating is justified

op_title: I believe that cheating is acceptable in the high stress environment that students are placed in today because of higher requirements for entry to college and more and more pressure from society. CMV

Rather than propping up a corrupt and unjust system that will only get worse with time, students who scholastically deserve what they're not getting should be working to expose the cheating of those who rob them of their future. By capitulating to the broken system, they allow the entrants to universities to be diluted by cheaters who can't do the work. While the short-term gains to the student may seem justifiable, essentially, the cost is far higher... intelligent students should be able to see that.

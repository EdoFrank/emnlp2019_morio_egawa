op_title: I believe that both parents need to consent to having a child for one to receive child support from the other - CMV

The current setup is a second-best solution.

Best: Society provides resources to all kids who need them

Second-best: Society uses some stop-gap measure to get resources to kids who need them.

Worst: Kids don't get needed resources.

You're right that, in a reasonable world, we wouldn't use child-support laws to get resources to children.  Those laws have all kinds of flaws, from problems of consent, to the absurd idea that a child's right to support depends on the wealth of its parents.

But, the problem with the "Remove Child Support" position is that it's taking steps in the wrong order.  If we take away the stop-gap measure, we move into the worst-case.  No one wants starving kids.  And the unfairness of "Random Kid Starves" is worse than the unfairness of "random person loses X% of their income."  

Instead, I think your position should be, "As a society we don't want kids to starve.  So, we should start replacing the child-support system with a society-based system.  That way, only people who want to be a kids guardian will be the guardians."

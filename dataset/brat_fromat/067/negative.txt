This reeks of 'Men's Rights' bullshit, yes there are PLENTY of flaws in the legal system that more often than not benefit women, but there's PLENTY of flaws in the 'society system' that more often than not benefit men.

Bottom line is, nature provided us with sex purely to make babies, there's no such thing as a 100% contraception method. Don't have sex if you aren't prepared for the IDEA of having a child. 

You already contented to having child by having sex, that's what sex is for. We as humans have separated "Sex" and "Sex to have children", but in natures eye's it's all the same.

My view applies to countries with freely accessible healthcare, and if pregnancy prevention methods can be used by both partners.

For those who do not wish to have children, there are plenty of contraception options available for both the man and the woman. In the unlikely scenario that these methods fail to do their job and an unwanted pregnancy does occur, there is always the option for the woman to have a safe abortion. In the case that the woman or the man doesn't want to have the child, is it fair that one of them should have to bear the burden of an unwanted kid? 
We should not prioritise someone's personal or religious beliefs if they go against what is scientifically proven and the welfare of others. During pregnancy, only the mother has control over something that is  to become the responsibility of both her and the father. Shouldn't the father have some degree of control over wether he wishes to take on that responsibility?

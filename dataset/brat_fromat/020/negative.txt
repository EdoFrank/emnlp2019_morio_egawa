It really depends on how you read the news. I myself have a google newsfeed, and I scan it a few times a day to check for a tailored set of developments that I think could actually influence the world's overall status quo. Science, world events, BBC, Technology, major business stories, and major US politics.
Things I have specifically banned from my feed: any celebrity story of any kind. "One weird trick" Health stories. "Weather happened and it killed 2 people" stories.

My goal is to see how the world, as a whole, is developing. I use the incoming information to piece together political trends, scientfic discoveries that matter, and public opinion changes. It requires concentration, creative thought, and a logical mind. It's also a lot of fun. 

TL;DR
I agree with your point, but only for sensationalized news stories. Looking at history in the making is a lot more fun.

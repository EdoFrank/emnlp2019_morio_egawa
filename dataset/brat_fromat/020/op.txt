op_title: News is bad for you. CMV

The points made in [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/apr/12/news-is-bad-rolf-dobelli)  Guardian article:

* News misleads - A car drives over a bridge, and the bridge collapses. What does the news media focus on? The car. The person in the car. Where he came from. Where he planned to go. How he experienced the crash (if he survived). But that is all irrelevant. What's relevant? The structural stability of the bridge.
* News is irrelevant to your life - Out of the approximately 10,000 news stories you have read in the last 12 months, name one that – because you consumed it – allowed you to make a better decision about a serious matter affecting your life, your career or your business.
* News has no explanatory power - Will accumulating facts help you understand the world? Sadly, no.
* News is toxic to your body - It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones.
* News increases cognitive errors -  News feeds the mother of all cognitive errors: confirmation bias. 
* News inhibits thinking - Thinking requires concentration. Concentration requires uninterrupted time. News pieces are specifically engineered to interrupt you. 
* News works like a drug - As stories develop, we want to know how they continue. With hundreds of arbitrary storylines in our heads, this craving is increasingly compelling and hard to ignore.
* News wastes time
* News makes us passive - News stories are overwhelmingly about things you cannot influence
* News kills creativity

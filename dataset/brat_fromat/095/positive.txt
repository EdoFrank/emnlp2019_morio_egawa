The best argument against forcing immunizations is respect for autonomy when it comes to medical procedures. 

Also, force is not always the best solution, take sanctions against drugs, or alcohol (in the past) etc. Now compare tobacco smoking - education (and higher taxes) have done wonders to lower the number of smokers. 

It seems to me that better information and education for anti-vaxxers would go a lot further. I think spreading good information has a better impact anyway, people understanding *why* it is necessary and beneficial.

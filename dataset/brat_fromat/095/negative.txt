There are communities who have religious opposition to vaccines have had those beliefs for hundreds of years, and the diseases have been stopped just fine without forcing them to violate their religious beliefs and violating their first amendment rights in the process.

I'm with you that people with ideological opposition are idiots who shouldn't be allowed to place their children in harms way because a brother of a friend of a friend of a friend totally got the autism from a vaccine and Jenny McCarthy swears it's a conspiracy, but people with religious reasons have had them for a lot longer than the current problem, and are few enough in number that it doesn't affect herd immunity.

T3	Value 228 293	[Faith](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define+faith) is not based on reason
T4	Value 306 344	most religions are not based on reason
T5	Value 350 462	for someone to say they hold a particular view or want to do a certain thing for religious reasons is misleading

T7	Value 656 799	Whether or not we should have reasons behind our beliefs is entirely different, I just don't think there are such things as 'religious reasons'

You're argument is basically one of semantics. I mean, I could say "My religion caused me to do X" or I could say "I did X for a religious reason". I'm saying literally exactly the same thing, but only the second doesn't work in your opinion?

Maybe, a better way or saying it would be that you don't think religion or faith should be used as evidence for an assertion. That means something quite different than what your post entails, but it would probably be more accurate.

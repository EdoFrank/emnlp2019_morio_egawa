op_title: I don't think religious reasons are valid, for anything really, because religions are not based on reason. CMV

A few premises so that people can discuss specific points:

Most religions are based on faith.

[Faith](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=define+faith) is not based on reason.

Therefore most religions are not based on reason.  So for someone to say they hold a particular view or want to do a certain thing for religious reasons is misleading because it's not because of 'reasons' that they hold that view but because of something else entirely, usually because they have faith in something, which by it's definition isn't reasonable.

Whether or not we should have reasons behind our beliefs is entirely different, I just don't think there are such things as 'religious reasons'.

Have fun.

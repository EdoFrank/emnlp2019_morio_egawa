op_title: I don't think religious reasons are valid, for anything really, because religions are not based on reason. CMV

&gt; [reaÂ·son](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reason?s=t)
&gt; 1. a basis or cause, as for some belief, action, fact, event, etc.: the reason for declaring war.
&gt; 2. a statement presented in justification or explanation of a belief or action.
&gt; 3. the mental powers concerned with forming conclusions, judgments, or inferences.
&gt; 4. sound judgment; good sense.

In definitions one and two if someone's belief in a religion causes them to do or believe in something they are doing it for a religious reason because their religion is the cause and used as justification.  In definition three if they apply their religious system of belief to conclude, judge, or infer something, they are using religious reasoning.  For definition four, if their are no logical inconsistencies between the person holding a view or doing something and their religious system of belief they are using religious reason.   

Faith in god may be a basic assumption of most religions but off of that assumption is a myriad of reasoning.  And the basic assumption doesn't necessarily make it "bad" or illogical reasoning either, as all reasoning processes make basic assumptions.

op_title: I don't think that any social drinking (alcohol) is justifiable. CMV

I am unaware of any positive effects of drinking alcohol even as a social lubricant. At various levels of intoxication, it lowers inhibition, reaction time, focus, vision, and decision-making capability. I put more emphasis on the last one listed, decision-making, since the lack of judgement due to alcohol is what causes many of the anecdotal mistakes I have read/heard. Therefore, I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to drink alcohol for any reason any other drink (or even any other "action") could also fill.

op_title: I don't think that any social drinking (alcohol) is justifiable. CMV

The fundamental flaw with your reasoning is that you assume that an action has to be justified. Do I also have to justify my love of pepperoni pizza? How about my coffee in the morning? Do I have to justify buying a BMW because, "I find it baffling that anyone would consciously choose to ~~drink alcohol~~ buy a BMW for any reason any other ~~drink~~ car could also fill."?

Certainly not. If that were true, then I could likewise make you justify your decision *not* to drink. 

Alcohol is a dangerous drug if it's abused. It certainly can lead people to make poor decisions, and can even lead to death. It appears that what you have an issue with is alcoholism or binge drinking, not drinking alcohol itself. The two are very different. As with many things, moderation is the key.

Personally, I don't drink very often - maybe once a month. I enjoy the taste of a finely blended whisky or a very old Scotch. Your statement that any other drink or any other action could fill the same purpose as a glass of The Glenlivet 18 year is simply untrue. The key is to drink responsibly. You control the drink, don't let the drink control you. If you can't do that, then you're not mature enough to drink.

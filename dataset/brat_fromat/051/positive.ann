T1	Value 132 268	The biggest issue is that you're challenging your years of knowledge and experience with a small amount of time with the "opposing view"
T2	Value 270 400	If I went from my vim/tmux/rake/ruby/rails/command-line work into VS, I'm sure I would find myself very uncomfortable very quickly
T3	Value 411 424	I know I will
T4	Testimony 433 525	when I did some iOS work in XCode and some Android work in Eclipse, I was very uncomfortable
T5	Testimony 750 889	the majority of the time I'm doing work on apps, I don't need or use the debugger -- not that I don't have one, but it doesn't come up much
T6	Value 891 940	It's a (if you forgive the phrase) paradigm shift
T7	Testimony 942 979	I write my tests and I make them pass
T8	Testimony 981 1096	There's not much need for a debugger until I'm plugging through someone else's code and I need to figure things out
T9	Testimony 1107 1148	I have gdb, pry, and the debugger in ruby
T10	Testimony 1157 1189	I don't "only" use a text editor
T11	Testimony 1191 1213	I use vim as my editor
T12	Value 1225 1265	even there it's not "just" a text editor
T13	Value 1274 1299	it's a damned fine editor
T14	Testimony 1302 1526	It's also where I run my tests fromt, it's provides syntax highlighting and code formatting (gg=G to indent and format the whole file is nice), it provides autocomplete, it provides jumping to method and variable definitions
T15	Testimony 1587 1761	I also use tmux, which puts a console into the same terminal as vim (among other things) And coupled with vim, I hit \t and it dispatch.vim pops up a split where my tests run
T16	Testimony 1763 1888	The results are parsed into a nice, usable format that I can automatically jump to the files and lines where the failures are
T17	Testimony 1890 1993	If I have to quit the terminal, I can jump back to exactly how my terminal was the second I had to quit
T18	Testimony 1996 2175	I can pair program with someone literally anywhere that internet access exists, completely seamlessly -- they don't even need anything installed on their system past an SSH client
T19	Value 2178 2287	The only way I can justify the "going back 20 years" statement is that you think terminals themselves are old
T20	Value 2309 2338	IDEs are garbled, slow messes
T21	Value 2351 2378	we both have our prejudices

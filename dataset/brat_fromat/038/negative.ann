T1	Value 146 185	Many people actually enjoy this freedom
T2	Value 187 244	They enjoy traveling, working in different locations, etc
T3	Value 246 352	[Hobo's are 'workers who wander,'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo) and even have their own ethical code
T4	Value 354 467	I don't think it's right to force them to conform to societies expectations, i.e. living and working in one place
T5	Testimony 471 561	I personally have moved between several states in the last few years for job opportunities
T6	Testimony 563 693	If a State had suppressed my ability to move, I likely wouldn't have had the ability to learn new skills, and become more valuable
T7	Value 1127 1263	this is a reason to arrest the ones that break the law, not the ones that are over all good citizens who just like living on the streets
T8	Policy 1278 1378	we should make it easier for people to live on the streets without being harassed by police officers
T9	Value 1381 1459	It also raises the notion of why people live on the streets in the first place
T10	Value 1461 2028	Is it zoning laws, lack of unaffordable housing, restrictions on structures (i.e. tents are illegal), [because so many psychiatric facilities were closed in the middle of the last century, with no laternatives being created](http://books.google.ca/books?id=-CwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=homeless+problem+asylums+closing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c-s2YwvLG0&amp;sig=apF_l5dzx_NA62PA08La5sNWk-E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UBlgTaD1CoK8lQfGpMS1DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=400%2C000&amp;f=false), etc, etc
T11	Value 2030 2264	Rounding up homeless people and putting them into 'reeducation' centers does nothing to stop new people from becoming homeless, or to address the underlying mental health issues that often *can't* be treated with drugs or even therapy
T12	Policy 2611 2750	If you think people need help, you should donate your time/money at homeless shelters, or helping homeless people in other ways if possible
T13	Value 2752 2982	There's absolutely no reason to give the Government any power to round up *more people*, especially with their current track record of putting people in cages (re: [The Drug War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_prison_population))
T14	Value 2992 3143	if the Government had a track record of *actually* helping people out, instead of making situations worse, they would be a good candidate for this task
T15	Value 3154 3273	I see no evidence of this, and think it's best to let people do what they want, so long as they don't hurt other people

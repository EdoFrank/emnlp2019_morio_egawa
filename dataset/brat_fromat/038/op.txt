op_title: I think homelessness should be illegal. CMV

I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it. Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) 

But when I tell people I think the government should make vagabondry illegal, and ship em off to "help facilities" I get looked at like my last name is [Manderley](http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Joseph_Manderley). Or even Hitler.

While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death.

Are my views wrong?

Edit: I forgot to clarify, I'm canadian. I don't support the war on drugs, or the overblown US incarceration.

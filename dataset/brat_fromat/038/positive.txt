And how do you propose to pay for all of this?  Sure it's a noble effort that you want to get everyone the help they deserve but this would be a massive effort and require the funding and man power to back it up. Also people have lies where they are, who is to say that you may relocate someone who just recently became homeless and is looking to get bak on their feet. Also you assume that all homeless don't have jobs. I've met quite a few who do work all day and struggle after because they cannot afford housing because they simply do not make enough money.

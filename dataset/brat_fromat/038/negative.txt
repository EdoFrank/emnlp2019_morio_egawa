op_title: I think homelessness should be illegal. CMV

&gt; I think people who live on the street need help, even if they dont want it

Many people actually enjoy this freedom. They enjoy traveling, working in different locations, etc. [Hobo's are 'workers who wander,'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo) and even have their own ethical code. I don't think it's right to force them to conform to societies expectations, i.e. living and working in one place. 

I personally have moved between several states in the last few years for job opportunities. If a State had suppressed my ability to move, I likely wouldn't have had the ability to learn new skills, and become more valuable. 

&gt;  Large denominations of vagabonds are drug addicted, and need therapy. Many are runaway children from broken homes with no life skills, and need guardianship. A large number are insane, and need to be evaluated, medicated or put into an institution. And let's be honest, many need a shower. On top of all that, a fair number are criminals, concealing weapons (two of my friends got stabbed/bottled downtown by beggers) 

But this is a reason to arrest the ones that break the law, not the ones that are over all good citizens who just like living on the streets. If anything, we should make it easier for people to live on the streets without being harassed by police officers.

It also raises the notion of why people live on the streets in the first place. Is it zoning laws, lack of unaffordable housing, restrictions on structures (i.e. tents are illegal), [because so many psychiatric facilities were closed in the middle of the last century, with no laternatives being created](http://books.google.ca/books?id=-CwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=homeless+problem+asylums+closing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c-s2YwvLG0&amp;sig=apF_l5dzx_NA62PA08La5sNWk-E&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UBlgTaD1CoK8lQfGpMS1DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=400%2C000&amp;f=false), etc, etc. Rounding up homeless people and putting them into 'reeducation' centers does nothing to stop new people from becoming homeless, or to address the underlying mental health issues that often *can't* be treated with drugs or even therapy.

&gt; While the responsible citizen in me recognizes the danger in giving government power to ship off people into detention/forced care, I can't help but feel that some people need it, especially against their will, if their freedom will lead them into drug addiction, crime, prostitution, illness, unplanned parenthood and potentially death.

If you think people need help, you should donate your time/money at homeless shelters, or helping homeless people in other ways if possible. There's absolutely no reason to give the Government any power to round up *more people*, especially with their current track record of putting people in cages (re: [The Drug War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_prison_population)). Perhaps if the Government had a track record of *actually* helping people out, instead of making situations worse, they would be a good candidate for this task. However, I see no evidence of this, and think it's best to let people do what they want, so long as they don't hurt other people.

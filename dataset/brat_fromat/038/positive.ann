T4	Value 283 433	people have lies where they are, who is to say that you may relocate someone who just recently became homeless and is looking to get bak on their feet
T5	Value 440 484	you assume that all homeless don't have jobs
T6	Testimony 486 625	I've met quite a few who do work all day and struggle after because they cannot afford housing because they simply do not make enough money

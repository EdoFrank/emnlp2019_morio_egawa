You cannot cycle or get public transport in rural areas.  What you are advocating would shift all people to living in the city which is not practical or affordable for many people.  I grew up in the country 30 miles from the nearest town where there is no public transportation.  My family was not wealthy enough to just buy a new house in some city.  We also would not have been able to keep our animals in the city.  What do you propose that farmers do?  You're most likely not going to be able to put a 20 acre farm anywhere that has decent public transportation.  Do you consider the family farmer a company?  If not, and they should not own cars, how do you expect them to transport their produce to the market?

I live in a city now, and I cannot even take public transportation because they have trimmed the budget and cut all the bus lines.  Cycling is not practical in the snow.  There is no way I could get to work without a car.  At one point, I moved somewhere with the sole purpose of not having to drive anywhere and taking public transportation everywhere, but then the line I took was cut back making it impossible for me to use public transportation.  The city also had no way to enter on foot or on a bicycle.  You had to be in a motor vehicle.

You are also expecting companies that won't even fork over the cash to pay decent living wages or buy employees health insurance to buy cars for their employees.  That is not going to happen.  Wal-Mart and Papa Johns will force cash strapped communities to pay to transport their employees to work.

This response isn't even taking into consideration those individuals with physical disabilities that cannot be expected to ride a bicycle to work.

I'd like to know where you live if you think public transportation and cycling only would enable you to get to your desired expectations.

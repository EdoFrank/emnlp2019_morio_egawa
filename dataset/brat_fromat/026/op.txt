op_title: No one should personally own a car or other motor vehicles CMV

Basically you can(/should be able to) cycle or get public transport to shops and places of work.

If you get a job far away you should move house or you will be provided a company car.

Cars and vans will still be available for hire so people can go on holidays or for moving house.

&gt; Basically you can(/should be able to) cycle

That doesn't work in all climates. If you lived in a very cold or very warm place, you you wouldn't want to cycle.

&gt; or get public transport to shops and places of work.

Public transport takes ages to get to the same place you're going to, and it often doesn't take you there directly, but through many intermediate steps. Furthermore, it doesn't take you there where you need to go, but it takes you more or less in the vicinity.

Granted, if what you propose were ever to become a reality, the network of public transport would become more extended, but I still doubt that it would be extended enough to provide a viable alternative.

And what should the elderly and people with disabilities do, when the bus drops them three blocks away from where they need to be?

Plus don't forget that not everyone lives in a city, and a bus cannot go to and from a country town every ten minutes. That would greatly limit the possibility of movement of people living in towns and villages.

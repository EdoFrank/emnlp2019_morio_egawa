op_title: I believe that no vaccine should be given to any child under one year of age, especially a newborn. CMV

They never used to give vaccines to babies or pregnant women. I do not think that they cause autism, but at the same time, I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed. I think at birth vaccinations are more harmful than the pharmaceutical industry lets on (i.e. mental illness rates have soared among children). Mercury is toxic. You shouldn't even eat tuna while you're pregnant. I'm not against vaccination, I'm a nursing student, it's a wonderful thing. I just don't think that we should administer anything that may derail a childs development at that early of an age. Vaccines should be administered after one year of age, at least.

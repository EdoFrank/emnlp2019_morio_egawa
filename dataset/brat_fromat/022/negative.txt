op_title: I believe that no vaccine should be given to any child under one year of age, especially a newborn. CMV

I do not have children, but if i did, i can assure you they would be getting vaccinated on schedule. The science is in, vaccinating children prevents them from getting sick. In the first six months of a childs life, the CDC recommends hepatitis b, diptheria, tetanus, pertussis vaccinations. Believe me, they are not doing it to make a child unwell. Is there a possibility that some children might have a reaction to these medications, sure. Its a ridiculously slim chance, way way lower than the chance of the child accidentally catching some of these diseases. It rankles that kids still die of whooping cough. Mostly from being in contact with someone who has been in contact with someone who has not immunised their child, or had not been immunised themselves. 

Why do you think that 1 year is the arbitrary point? What development are you derailing in giving a hep vaccine at 2 months? Im fairly sure the CDC did not create this schedule to put your child at risk.

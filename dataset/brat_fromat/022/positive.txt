op_title: I believe that no vaccine should be given to any child under one year of age, especially a newborn. CMV

&gt; I see no valid reason to give a crap load of chemicals to a child who's immune system has not developed.

From the CDC at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/fast-facts.html

&gt; In 2010, 27,550 cases of pertussis (whooping cough) were reported in the U.S., but many more go undiagnosed and unreported. This is the most number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1959 when 40,000 cases were reported. In 2011, 18,719 cases were reported.

&gt; Vaccinated children and adults can become infected with and transmit pertussis; however, disease is less likely to be severe.

&gt; More than half of infants less than 1 year of age who get pertussis are hospitalized.

From http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/complications.html

&gt; The younger the infant, the more likely treatment in the hospital will be needed. Of those infants who are hospitalized with pertussis about:

&gt; - 1 in 4 (23%) get pneumonia (lung infection)  
&gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will have convulsions (violent, uncontrolled shaking)  
&gt; - Two thirds (67%) will have apnea (slowed or stopped breathing)  
&gt; - 1 in 300 (0.4%) will have encephalopathy (disease of the brain)  
&gt; - 1 or 2 in 100 (1.6%) will die

From this PDF http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/Provisional-Pertussis-Surveillance-Report.pdf , in 2012, there were 4516 reported cases of pertussis in babies under 1 year of age. 15 of those died; 13 of those 15 were under 3 months old. The first pertussis vaccine can be given at 2 months, IIRC from when my daughter was a baby.

Now. That's the damage pertussis can do. What is the damage DTaP can do?

From http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a682198.html

&gt; Severe Problems [from DTaP] (Very Rare):  

&gt; - Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)  
&gt; - Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include: long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness; permanent brain damage. These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.

Answer: nothing. There have been zero deaths from DTaP. Cases of severe problems (things that derail a child's development) are so rare it's hard to tell if they're caused by the vaccine.

Recap: in 2012 alone, 15 babies under 1 year of age died from pertussis. Zero people died from the DTaP vaccine.

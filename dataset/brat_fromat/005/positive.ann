T1	Value 272 387	I want to know what you mean when you say you don't believe men can be raped by women, but that you *know* they can
T2	Value 389 442	I don't understand what it is you're trying to convey
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 444 487	Do you just want to know how it's possible?
T4	Value 571 628	Rape, as I'm sure you know, comes in many different forms
T5	Value 630 691	I don't want to actually detail methods that would cause pain
T6	Value 706 762	you believe that some sex can hurt if you're not careful
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 764 859	What do you think would happen if the person having sex with you doesn't care about you at all?
T8	Value 860 938	They probably wouldn't give a shit how rough they are, or how abusive they are
T9	Value 943 1029	the answer is yes, unless you're talking about coercion, which is another can of worms
T10	Value 1235 1272	I see the fundamental disconnect here
T11	Value 1275 1368	There's a social stigma that men just want sex, and if they fail to get it, they're not manly
T12	Value 1370 1510	It happens in every "dude man bro spring breeeeak" movie that comes out where at least one of the jokes is, some guy gets rejected by a girl
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1512 1526	Wah-wah-waaaah
T14	Value 1528 1626	This also objectifies the girl, but we're talking about the part of this stigma that affects males
T15	Value 1643 1743	you may have the impression that men don't have as many inhibitions when it comes to sex as women do
T16	Value 1833 1848	this isn't true
T17	Testimony 1850 2007	I've had enough sexual experience to know that sex can feel wonderful, dangerous, exciting, disgusting, and *wrong* in the bad way, depending on the incident
T18	Value 2010 2107	If someone were to coerce me into sex, or physically restrain and rape me, I would be traumatized
T19	Value 2109 2139	There's no question in my mind
T20	Value 2141 2272	To have control of such a basic part of yourself taken away with no purpose but for someone else's pleasure would probably break me
T21	Value 2278 2319	you're not talking about emotional trauma
T22	Value 2322 2363	Rape usually isn't about just getting sex
T23	Value 2365 2410	It's about a desire to control another person
T24	Value 2423 2600	female-on-male rape isn't predicated on PIV sex, but rather it might involve sodomy with a phallic object, physical abuse, and restraint, if you're looking for only the physical
T25	Value 2820 2883	This is actually a trend that bothers the living shit out of me
T26	Value 2889 2904	I'll stay civil
T27	Value 2916 3043	you're familiar with Reddit's gross negligence for the worth of women when it comes to jokes and one-off hypothetical scenarios
T28	Value 3045 3211	It's like one of Reddit's main features, that in every thread featuring a woman, one of the comment threads will be about how the girl is hot, or a bitch, or whatever
T29	Value 3226 3310	if I were to take this to mean "girls must be hot or bitches," you'd want to slap me
T30	Rhetorical_Statement 3313 3390	Remember how I said there's a social stigma that guys are only in it for sex?
T31	Value 3391 3461	Some people measure the worth of a man by how appealing he is to women
T32	Value 3463 3491	That's why Magic Mike exists
T33	Value 3521 3569	a lot of guys are insecure about their sexuality
T34	Rhetorical_Statement 3578 3587	the jokes
T35	Value 3589 3651	It's a mechanism for dealing with hearing of a man being raped
T36	Rhetorical_Statement 3654 3748	Why, if a woman wants to have sex with me, that means I'm a better man for her than other men!
T37	Rhetorical_Statement 3749 3795	How can being raped by a woman be so horrible?
T38	Rhetorical_Statement 3796 3843	Doesn't that just mean she wants me really bad?
T39	Value 3845 3886	They just can't understand what it's like
T40	Value 3896 3951	they don't have to deal with the fear of that happening
T41	Value 3954 4006	Sex is a goal for the stereotypical male, not a vice
T42	Value 4010 4036	With women, it's different
T43	Value 4038 4114	Sex is forbidden, an exotic gift only given to the one that woman has chosen
T44	Value 4116 4153	To take it unduly is a horrible thing
T45	Value 4162 4186	it's so important to her
T46	Value 4188 4295	Notice that this last point is actually completely correct -- it's just not considered as important for men
T47	Value 4305 4399	the stereotypical man has sex with multiple people over his life, and it's not that big a deal
T48	Value 4401 4536	Basically in basic human society (and going back to before recorded history, in fact) the girl sticks with one guy, but guys get around
T49	Value 4538 4702	We live in a modern society now, where that idea does us no good and perpetuates a culture where sexism and that sex-based concept of worth can only ever be harmful

T1	Major_Claim 19 66	I don't believe men can be raped by women. CMV.
T2	Value 440 482	Part of me knows men can be raped by women
T3	Value 502 521	it's fairly obvious
T4	Value 523 597	If men don't give their consent and women have sex with them anyway = rape
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 599 613	Simple as that
T6	Value 639 663	I'm just really confused
T7	Value 665 744	I'm having trouble coming to terms with how it's possible for women to rape men
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 746 822	Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)?
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 823 953	I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it?
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 961 1011	it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1017 1082	does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)?
T12	Value 1107 1139	it would be emotionally damaging
T13	Value 1143 1303	Back to my whole "enjoy it" point, if you flip it around, I'm MORE than aware that it would be absurd to say to women victims that they could've just enjoyed it
T14	Value 1315 1452	the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc
T15	Testimony 1461 1574	I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it "ridiculous")
T16	Testimony 1576 1652	I also remember seeing a tweet on one of those true fact accounts on Twitter
T17	Testimony 1654 1809	The tweet said something along the lines of a man was raped at knife point by five women (his wives? Can't really remember but it doesn't matter right now)
T18	Testimony 1811 1921	A few of the comments were guys going "what a way to go!" and "sounds good" and just general positive comments
T19	Value 1934 2021	this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped
T20	Value 2113 2163	people who think like I do are part of the problem

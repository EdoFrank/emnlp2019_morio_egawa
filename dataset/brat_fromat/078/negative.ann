T1	Testimony 118 348	As a mathematics and computer science major, I personally study best from doing practice problems over and over until I've sharpened my intuition as well as my working knowledge of how the tools I have learned relate to each other
T2	Testimony 350 397	This process takes much longer than a few hours
T3	Value 400 503	In abstract mathematics especially, knowing the definitions simply isn't enough to be ready for an exam
T4	Value 505 637	You have to know how to attack problems, where hangups and issues can arise, and you're racing against the clock for the entire exam
T5	Value 639 722	Without having done practice problems to get me in the zone, I will not be prepared
T6	Value 729 818	all the homework I do over the course of the semester is good practice and helps me learn
T7	Value 824 972	you move away from topics quickly and it's very easy to forget how to use certain definitions and ideas if you haven't touched them for a few months

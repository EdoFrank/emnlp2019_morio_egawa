I have heard many people talk about how students shouldn't wait until the night before an exam to study and I have seen many of my friends study for over ten hours for a single exam. I do not understand why doing this is necessary. The purpose of an exam is to quantify how well students understand material that has already been taught. Everything that an exam covers, the students are expected to already have learned through lectures, reading the book, homework assignments, labs, etc. At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know. It is my understanding that the purpose of studying is to refresh your memory and recall details about things you learned a month ago that you had since forgotten. If that is case, it shouldn't take more than a few hours to do.

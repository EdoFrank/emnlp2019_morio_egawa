op_title: I believe that it should never take more than a few hours the night before an exam to study. CMV

&gt;At the point that a student is studying for an exam, all of the information they need, they should already know.

This is why exam weeks were awesome--it was nice to be able to relax from the normal pace.  

Out of curiosity, are/were you a science or engineering major?  I think those subjects lend themselves well to not having to study much for exams because foundational concepts are taught as the building blocks for more complex material.

It seems that classes where early information isn't regularly referenced in later material (or logically connected somehow) would take longer to study for, since the material is easier to forget.

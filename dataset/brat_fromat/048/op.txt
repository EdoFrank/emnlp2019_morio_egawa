op_title: I don't trust insurance companies one bit and thus never plan to get insurance. CMV

First off, I live in a country that has a public health system, so I am not referring to health insurance in this.

I just dont see how having insurance is better then paying for something out of your own savings. I feel in the vast, vast majority of cases you would save money this way. I feel that having insurance for a very, very unlikely scenario is just the same as gambling.

I also feel that insurance companies will make it as hard as possible for you to make a claim and will try and reject you as much as possible (eg: 'Act of God'). I feel that government bodies who are supposed to regulate and monitor these such things have no teeth and dont make it any better. Even if you were to try to claim insurance for something very expensive, I do not think they would pay you.

I believe the amount of claims that you would make during your lifetime will never exceed even half of what you pay for insurance.

Everyone tells me I should get it so obviously there is something in it. I just need to CMV!

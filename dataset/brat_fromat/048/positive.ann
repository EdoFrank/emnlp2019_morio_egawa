T1	Value 179 264	insurance in general is used to cover losses - especially on things you cannot afford
T2	Value 290 346	you would not insure something that is worth very little
T3	Value 357 461	something like auto insurance could lead to protecting you from claims that would otherwise bankrupt you
T4	Value 464 504	You're measuring a cost benefit analysis
T5	Value 552 596	that is not the way it needs to be looked at
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 599 642	Let me demonstrate with a numerical example
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 655 680	your net worth is $100000
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 681 745	if you get into a car accident, the damages will be over $100000
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 748 805	the probability of you getting into a car accident is .1%
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 809 893	A car insurance company would charge you more than .1% * 100000 = $100 to insure you
T11	Value 895 1054	Your implication (which I agree with) is that the more than $100 (let's assume $200 for the rest of my post) they will charge for insurance is higher than fair
T12	Value 1057 1091	Here is why I don't agree with you
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1095 1146	With Insurance: Net worth = $100000 - $200 = $99800
T14	Rhetorical_Statement 1149 1195	No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $99800
T15	Rhetorical_Statement 1198 1239	Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $99800
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 1243 1281	Without Insurance: Net worth = $100000
T17	Rhetorical_Statement 1284 1331	No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $100000
T18	Rhetorical_Statement 1334 1371	Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $0
T19	Rhetorical_Statement 1373 1503	Would you not rather have a guaranteed net worth of $99800 (instead of $100000) than risk the chance of being completely bankrupt?
T20	Value 1535 1713	if the numbers are the same and your net worth is 100 million instead of 100000 I can see your perspective as the worst case scenario would not put a large dent in your lifestyle

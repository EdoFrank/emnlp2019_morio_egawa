I'm not sure what type of insurance you're specifically referring to. But insurance in general is used to cover losses - especially on things you cannot afford.

I agree with you, that you would not insure something that is worth very little. However, something like auto insurance could lead to protecting you from claims that would otherwise bankrupt you.

You're measuring a cost benefit analysis. Odds of using vs benefit from using. However, that is not the way it needs to be looked at.

Let me demonstrate with a numerical example:

Assume:  
your net worth is $100000
if you get into a car accident, the damages will be over $100000  
the probability of you getting into a car accident is .1%  

A car insurance company would charge you more than .1% * 100000 = $100 to insure you. Your implication (which I agree with) is that the more than $100 (let's assume $200 for the rest of my post) they will charge for insurance is higher than fair.

Here is why I don't agree with you:  
With Insurance: Net worth = $100000 - $200 = $99800  
No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $99800  
Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $99800  

Without Insurance: Net worth = $100000  
No Accident (99.9% chance): Net worth = $100000  
Accident (.1% chance): Net worth = $0

Would you not rather have a guaranteed net worth of $99800 (instead of $100000) than risk the chance of being completely bankrupt?




That all having been said, if the numbers are the same and your net worth is 100 million instead of 100000 I can see your perspective as the worst case scenario would not put a large dent in your lifestyle

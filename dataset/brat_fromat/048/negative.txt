Insurance is the same as the extended warranty on appliances. You are paying more up front to prevent yourself financial disaster if something happened. Of Course the insurance companies are able to price premiums in a way they always stay profitable. You however get the benefit of piece of mind, knowing if the worst happens you are covered. Auto insurance is important because most people couldn't afford to pay a huge claim out of pocket and they also cover uninsured drivers hitting you. All insurance is probably considered negative lifetime equity, however they are important in  helping people avoid financial disasters. One massive car accident, home fire or medical claim could bankrupt you and your family.

op_title: I believe a lot of people will never find "love", CMV

It seems like a core assumption in your argument (correct me if this is wrong) is that people will have only one relationship in their lifetimes. This is in fact wildly inaccurate, and many people will find love 2, 3, or even 10 or more times in their lives. As such, it's certainly possible, even if there are wildly unequal numbers of men and women, for all of them to find love at some point in their lives.

Imagine, for example, a society with 100 men and 20 women. If those women have an average of 5 or more relationships in their lives, it's definitely possible for all 100 of those men to find love at least once in theirs.

&gt;Edit 1: take a look at R4R, for any given female, her post it's more likely to have 5 or more replies than a male one, which in average will have 1 or 2 replies, if he is lucky, of course that isn't a rule, because female more likely will send a private message than a public post, still it shows something.

R4R is a terrible example, because Reddit is nowhere near representative of the entire world when it comes to ratio of men to women. Your stats put it at somewhere around 2.177/2.113, but on Reddit it's more like 3/1 if memory serves.

T1	Major_Claim 20 115	Obama is the best we could do 2008-2013 and complaining about his presidency is pointless, CMV.
T2	Value 117 210	I know a lot of people complain about Obama and hate on him, even the fairly "liberal" people
T3	Value 221 382	in the US, realistically, Democrats and Republicans are the only ones that are capable of taking the seat in the Oval Office due our (seemingly) two party system
T4	Value 385 492	If Romney or McCain was elected into the office, we would (more than likely) still have the PRISM, NDA, etc
T5	Value 498 610	not only would we have that, we would have strict abortion laws, no progress for gay rights, women's rights, etc
T6	Value 615 725	I'd much rather have a PRISM supporting president that supports equality than one who is a social conservative
T7	Testimony 728 881	Whenever I hear people complain on Reddit about Obama (and the majority Reddit is pro-equality), I always point that out, but get downvoted into oblivion
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 883 910	Please tell me why that is?

I think you're looking at the complaints (though not all of them) from the wrong approach.

The fact that people feel backed into a one or the other, lesser of two evils choice every four years is enough reason for disdain as is, but it is only compounded by a trend that seems to grow every election; executive or legislative.

People are voting for a President or representative and expect them to be their voice in steering the country in the direction the people want.  These people get elected, however, and do what **they** see as right.  People are complaining about that, not so much the man himself.

I never understood why politicians told me how they felt about certain issues.  I don't give a shit how they feel, I want someone who will vote, or in the President's case veto/pass, what the majority wants.

But they rarely do and people complain.  Is the complaining pointless? No. It gets attention. With enough attention change may come about, whether it leads to an internal reform of how things are done, people voting a certain/different way or an all out revolution.

Now to address specific complaints toward Obama and the desire to remove him, this goes back to the idea that even though he was elected, he's not living up to the expectations of those who elected him.  If I had to buy a car and chose the 'best of what was offered' and ended up with a car that didn't run at all after a week, I'd want a new car.  Just because the salesman said it was great doesn't mean it was or that I should be obligated to keep it.

tl;dr Complaining isn't pointless, it raises awareness and may lead to change.

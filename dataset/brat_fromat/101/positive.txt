I don't think you'll find hard evidence that it's set *at birth*, but there is tremendous evidence that genetics play a big role. 

The most popular piece of evidence is a study done on twins. Identical twins are much more likely to be gay if the other one is gay than fraternal twins -- and the trend holds up even when identical twins are separated at birth. This controls for environmental factors extremely well and shows that their genetics do have a huge component to play in their sexuality.

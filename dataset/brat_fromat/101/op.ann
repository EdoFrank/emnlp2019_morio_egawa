T1	Major_Claim 21 108	I don't believe that, regarding sexual preference, we're necessarily born that way. CMV
T2	Value 134 227	I don't believe that sexual preference is a choice, or that it can be changed through therapy
T3	Value 229 275	the evidence definitely seems to be against it
T4	Value 279 409	When people say they they were "born that way," maybe what they really mean is simply that they didn't have a choice in the matter
T5	Value 411 433	In that sense, I agree
T6	Testimony 452 566	there isn't enough hard scientific evidence to support the theory that people are born straight/gay/bi/asexual/etc
T7	Value 576 598	the possibility exists
T8	Value 604 653	we can't at this point in time, say that for sure
T9	Value 664 877	another possibility is that while genetic factors, and hormonal influence may play a part, environmental (physical, emotional, social, etc.) factors after birth may also play a part in forming a person's sexuality
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 880 891	Am I wrong?

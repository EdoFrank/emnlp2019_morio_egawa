op_title: I don't believe that, regarding sexual preference, we're necessarily born that way. CMV

Let me first state that I don't believe that sexual preference is a choice, or that it can be changed through therapy (the evidence definitely seems to be against it).

When people say they they were "born that way," maybe what they really mean is simply that they didn't have a choice in the matter. In that sense, I agree.

However, AFAIK, there isn't enough hard scientific evidence to support the theory that people are born straight/gay/bi/asexual/etc. I think the possibility exists, but we can't at this point in time, say that for sure.

I think another possibility is that while genetic factors, and hormonal influence may play a part, environmental (physical, emotional, social, etc.) factors after birth may also play a part in forming a person's sexuality.

Am I wrong? CMV.

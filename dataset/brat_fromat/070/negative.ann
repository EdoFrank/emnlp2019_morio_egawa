T1	Value 141 261	The simplest way to understand this is to break the energy consumption of a car into two pieces: acceleration and cruise
T2	Value 263 341	When accelerating the weight of the car is extremely important to fuel economy
T3	Value 399 441	At cruise weight becomes almost negligible
T4	Value 450 511	the primary loss is from drag which is not effected by weight
T5	Value 514 606	From the very first gas-electric hybrid the key piece of technology was regenerative braking
T6	Fact 617 786	instead of throwing out all the energy that was spent accelerating the car each time you have to stop you recover it and store it in a battery for later use accelerating
T7	Value 788 862	For most hybrids the main fuel economy gain comes from stop and go driving
T8	Value 864 971	On the highway, hybrids and close to identical as possible gasoline powered cars are not all that different
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 978 1051	lets assume that a hybrid Prius is ~10% heavier than a conventional Prius
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 1056 1096	Hybrid = 1360 kg, Conventional = 1230 kg
T11	Fact 1098 1150	Accelerating to 100kph uses H = 525 kJ, C = 472.5 kJ
T12	Fact 1232 1321	they brake and the conventional loses all that energy while the hybrid recovers 50% of it
T13	Fact 1323 1468	Next time they accelerate the hybrid uses 262.5 kJ from the battery and 262.5 kJ from gasoline while the conventional uses 472.5 kJ from gasoline
T14	Value 1474 1645	even without any power source other than gas, higher efficiency engines, better RPM mapping, or any technology other than regenerative braking, the hybrid comes out on top

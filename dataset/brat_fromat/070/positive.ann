T1	Fact 358 463	[According to the Prius wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius), the battery pack weighs 118 lbs
T2	Testimony 471 499	I can't find a figure online
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 501 672	let's say the electric motor components (which are the major components for regenerative braking) add another 100 onto that even though that's almost certainly highballing
T4	Fact 677 828	218 pounds out of a total of around [2900 lb curb weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius_%28XW20%29) puts ~7.5% more weight onto the vehicle
T5	Value 830 860	Not as much as one might think
T6	Value 863 1013	It's also the weight of a full grown adult, so take into account how much more fuel you use driving somewhere with a friend as opposed to driving solo
T7	Fact 1020 1064	that weight hurts the vehicle's fuel economy
T8	Value 1069 1132	it is outweighed by the benefits gained by regenerative braking
T9	Value 1368 1501	The only way this would be possible is if that year of driving involved **significantly** less stopping than the average driver makes
T10	Value 1503 1685	At steady speed highway driving, you're absolutely correct in believing that non-plugin hybrids are outperformed by normal vehicles with equivalent size/efficiency combustion engines
T11	Value 1694 1714	it is simple physics
T12	Value 1717 1831	What you don't seem to be taking into account (or at least understating the importance of) is regenerative braking
T13	Fact 1833 1915	100% of the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle is lost due to conventional braking
T14	Fact 1917 2085	Regenerative braking on the other hand can return [as much as 50%](http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/regenerative-braking5.htm) of that energy
T15	Value 2126 2203	let's go with half of that and say that regenerative braking is 25% efficient
T16	Rhetorical_Statement 2206 2249	See the importance of regenerative braking?
T17	Fact 2250 2374	Using Newton's 2nd law, we can estimate that to get up to speed, Hybrid X uses 7.5% more energy (and fuel) than Non-Hybrid X
T18	Fact 2380 2476	then when they both stop, Hybrid X gains 25% of it's kinetic energy back that Non Hybrid X loses
T19	Value 2480 2508	This is especially important
T20	Value 2517 2627	vehicle weight doesn't have much to do with fuel consumption from driving at a steady speed (Newton's 1st law)
T21	Fact 2634 2709	weight contributes a bit to the rolling resistance of the tires on the road
T22	Fact 2715 2813	the predominant factor is aerodynamic drag-something that doesn't care about vehicle weight at all
T23	Value 3003 3189	unless you plan on doing much more highway driving than city driving (and even then the highway better not be very busy), a hybrid will be more efficient than it's non hybrid counterpart

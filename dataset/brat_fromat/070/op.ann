T1	Major_Claim 20 139	CMV: I believe that the fuel economy benefits offered by hybrid cars is a myth due to a basic understanding of physics.
T2	Value 160 291	the fuel efficiency of hybrid cars is an absolute myth and that this view can be supported by a very basic understanding of physics
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 293 345	Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement
T4	Value 348 461	The manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology
T5	Value 463 616	Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances
T6	Value 618 697	They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed
T7	Value 699 798	This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle
T8	Value 800 861	I would counter this view with the following three key points
T9	Value 868 1074	In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking)
T10	Fact 1092 1225	whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components
T11	Fact 1232 1363	A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it
T12	Value 1367 1480	When we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth
T13	Value 1510 1688	the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there
T14	Value 1716 1918	if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency  over a year of driving than an identical hybrid
T15	Value 1945 2131	hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy

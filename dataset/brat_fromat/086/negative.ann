T5	Value 316 381	If you do not get many views you will have a hard time continuing
T6	Value 383 519	Without a large amount of viewers your ads will bring in less revenue and ultimately lower the profits of the company providing the news
T7	Value 521 602	This will possibly cause the company to go out of business or stop providing news
T8	Value 605 653	We can look at this regarding news casters on TV
T9	Value 655 774	It tends to be during the morning / afternoon it is more hard news while in the prime time there are more opinion shows
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 776 780	Why?
T11	Value 789 864	people watch news more at night and they like bias and sensationalized news
T12	Value 866 952	If more people wanted hard news then there would be more hard news rather than opinion

The problem isn't that the media wants "views". What else would media ever want? The only reason to broadcast *anything* is if you want a lot of people to see it.

The problem, if it exists, would seem to be that the media wants to get *paid* for views. But that's been the model of media pretty much for as long as it has existed. 

Any time you get something for free on the internet, you are not the consumer, and what you're seeing is not the product. *You* are the product, and what you see is the means of production of that product. You get something nice, for free, because someone wants to pay someone else to buy your attention. 

And any problem we have with the media showing us what we want to see is a problem with *us*, not with the media. You're complaining about the wrong actor in this play.

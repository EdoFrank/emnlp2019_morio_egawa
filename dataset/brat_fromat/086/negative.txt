I agree with a majority of what you said, but you said they are **only** concerned with views. When you make absolutes such as that you are likely wrong.

Views is obviously an important factor. If you do not get many views you will have a hard time continuing. Without a large amount of viewers your ads will bring in less revenue and ultimately lower the profits of the company providing the news. This will possibly cause the company to go out of business or stop providing news.

We can look at this regarding news casters on TV. It tends to be during the morning / afternoon it is more hard news while in the prime time there are more opinion shows. Why? Because people watch news more at night and they like bias and sensationalized news. If more people wanted hard news then there would be more hard news rather than opinion.

op_title: CMV: Being spied upon does not take away your freedoms.

Also, it's interesting how the government can dare to spy on its citizens, but the citizens don't yet have the right to a fully transparent government. With the scandals lately, it's ironic that the government wants to know everything you're doing, but hardly knows what *it's* doing.

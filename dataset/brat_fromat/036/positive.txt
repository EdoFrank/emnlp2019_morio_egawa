Consider the Panopticon:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon

It's based on a reliable observation about human behavior: that we act differently when we think we're being watched, even if we aren't. A dummy camera can often be equally effective as a real one.

People restrain themselves when they think they're being watched, but the problem is that it's their own imagination of what the spy will do which governs their behavior. 

There is no policeman as effective as the one inside our own minds.

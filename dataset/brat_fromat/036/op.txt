op_title: CMV: Being spied upon does not take away your freedoms.

What are you not free to do if you are spied on that you were free to do before? There are things that many people do that are illegal that they can't do if they are spied on, but the aren't _really_ free to do them if they aren't spied on, they just get away with it.

Being spied on is obviously different if a specific person you know is doing the spying, but the government/FBI/CIA/etc. is not a specific person, its an organization. If they watch you have sex or whatever that doesn't effect your life at all except maybe for some discomfort at the fact that you might be on tape, which I think people should just get over.

Note: this does not mean I condone widespread spying by the government, I just think that freedom is not a good argument to use against spying. There are plenty of other good ones to use.

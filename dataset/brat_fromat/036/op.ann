T1	Major_Claim 20 75	CMV: Being spied upon does not take away your freedoms.
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 77 157	What are you not free to do if you are spied on that you were free to do before?
T3	Value 158 344	There are things that many people do that are illegal that they can't do if they are spied on, but the aren't _really_ free to do them if they aren't spied on, they just get away with it
T4	Value 347 434	Being spied on is obviously different if a specific person you know is doing the spying
T5	Fact 440 513	the government/FBI/CIA/etc. is not a specific person, its an organization
T6	Value 515 704	If they watch you have sex or whatever that doesn't effect your life at all except maybe for some discomfort at the fact that you might be on tape, which I think people should just get over
T7	Value 713 849	this does not mean I condone widespread spying by the government, I just think that freedom is not a good argument to use against spying
T8	Value 851 893	There are plenty of other good ones to use

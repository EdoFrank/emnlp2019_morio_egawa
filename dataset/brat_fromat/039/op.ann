T1	Major_Claim 20 66	(US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV.
T2	Value 74 150	I understand the irony of being forced to participate in a democratic system
T3	Policy 165 202	voting should be compulsory in the US
T4	Value 205 474	With a compulsory system, we could get a better idea of what EVERYONE thinks, (not just those that show up now, which are mostly ideologues on either side) and possibly get people that represent more of America, instead of polarizing politicians from the left and right
T5	Value 488 706	we would have to make it easier to vote in order to compensate for this policy: like moving election days to Saturdays instead of Tuesdays, or making election days national holidays, giving people pizza, whatever works
T6	Value 746 827	we need more than left wing politicians in order for a healthy democracy to exist

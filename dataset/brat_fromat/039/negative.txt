op_title: (US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV.

As someone else already noted, you'll have (well, we already have) nutbirds who know nothing but vote anyway.  So many people vote for the "nicest dude" or the person with the most campaign signs and have no idea about any of this person's proposed policies or stances.

Also, people who really didn't want to vote could just write "Billy Goat" in the write-in section, and therefore they haven't really voted...

What I think we should do is severely limit campaign time and money and eliminate political parties.  For example, candidates only start running a month before the election.  They have a few debates and clearly outline their policies and stances.  There are several candidates to choose from, and hopefully people will have to do (at least a miniscule amount of) research before choosing who to vote for).

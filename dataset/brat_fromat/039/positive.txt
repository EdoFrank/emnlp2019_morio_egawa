op_title: (US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV.

Making voting compulsory is a ridiculous idea for two reasons. 

Firstly, it would be monstrously expensive to enforce such a law. I have no idea how you'd even do it in the first place, and even if a system were devised, I have no interest in supporting such a thing with my taxes.

Of course, the more pressing issue is that many people simply don't care (a topic for another CMV perhaps), and their votes would skew the election. For example, a decent fraction of the country votes in the presidential election because even if you don't take a particularly active interest in the candidates, you hear enough through news outlets, social media, and word of mouth to develop an opinion. The legitimacy of the information you receive is questionable, but you at least know something about each candidate and you use this information to make a decision. On the off chance that this information doesn't intrigue you, you make the decision to not vote at all, and the election can be decided by people who do care. By the way, the right to vote, just like freedom of religion, should certainly include the right to not vote just as a person can choose to not follow a religion.

What about senatorial elections though? Do you even know who your representatives are for the state you live in? Most people don't and forcing those people to vote in an election involving politicians they know nothing about is an awful idea because their votes will essentially be probabilistic noise. Between two candidates, the uninformed voters will split 50/50 thus diluting the voters whom actually care.

Should we be more involved in our voting system in this country? Sure, but forcing people to do so is not the solution.

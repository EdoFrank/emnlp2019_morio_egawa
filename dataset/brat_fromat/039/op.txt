op_title: (US) I think voting should be compulsory. CMV.

While I understand the irony of being forced to participate in a democratic system, I think that voting should be compulsory in the US.

With a compulsory system, we could get a better idea of what EVERYONE thinks, (not just those that show up now, which are mostly ideologues on either side) and possibly get people that represent more of America, instead of polarizing politicians from the left and right.

Of course, we would have to make it easier to vote in order to compensate for this policy: like moving election days to Saturdays instead of Tuesdays, or making election days national holidays, giving people pizza, whatever works.

PS: I'm a total leftist, but I think we need more than left wing politicians in order for a healthy democracy to exist.

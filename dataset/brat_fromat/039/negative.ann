T2	Value 179 336	So many people vote for the "nicest dude" or the person with the most campaign signs and have no idea about any of this person's proposed policies or stances
T3	Rhetorical_Statement 345 477	people who really didn't want to vote could just write "Billy Goat" in the write-in section, and therefore they haven't really voted
T4	Policy 482 581	What I think we should do is severely limit campaign time and money and eliminate political parties
T5	Policy 597 654	candidates only start running a month before the election
T6	Policy 657 727	They have a few debates and clearly outline their policies and stances
T7	Value 730 885	There are several candidates to choose from, and hopefully people will have to do (at least a miniscule amount of) research before choosing who to vote for

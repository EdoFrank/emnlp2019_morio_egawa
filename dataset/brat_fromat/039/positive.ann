T1	Value 68 129	Making voting compulsory is a ridiculous idea for two reasons
T2	Value 142 197	it would be monstrously expensive to enforce such a law
T3	Value 199 349	I have no idea how you'd even do it in the first place, and even if a system were devised, I have no interest in supporting such a thing with my taxes
T4	Value 363 458	the more pressing issue is that many people simply don't care (a topic for another CMV perhaps)
T5	Value 464 499	their votes would skew the election
T6	Value 514 581	a decent fraction of the country votes in the presidential election
T7	Value 590 754	even if you don't take a particularly active interest in the candidates, you hear enough through news outlets, social media, and word of mouth to develop an opinion
T8	Value 756 817	The legitimacy of the information you receive is questionable
T9	Value 823 919	you at least know something about each candidate and you use this information to make a decision
T10	Value 921 1078	On the off chance that this information doesn't intrigue you, you make the decision to not vote at all, and the election can be decided by people who do care
T11	Policy 1092 1241	the right to vote, just like freedom of religion, should certainly include the right to not vote just as a person can choose to not follow a religion
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1244 1283	What about senatorial elections though?
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1284 1356	Do you even know who your representatives are for the state you live in?
T14	Value 1357 1485	Most people don't and forcing those people to vote in an election involving politicians they know nothing about is an awful idea
T15	Value 1494 1545	their votes will essentially be probabilistic noise
T16	Value 1547 1653	Between two candidates, the uninformed voters will split 50/50 thus diluting the voters whom actually care
T17	Rhetorical_Statement 1656 1720	Should we be more involved in our voting system in this country?
T18	Value 1731 1774	forcing people to do so is not the solution

op_title: Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring

I'm 16 years old, and throughout my childhood my parents have been kind of pretty overprotective, not too much but eventually it resulted in me being fearful of smoking, any drugs, and alcohol.

The two former I don't mind, I wouldn't by far like to be interested in smoking and/or doing drugs, but the latter is kind of worrying me - alcohol is pretty damn normal in society, and I can't grow up sipping cola always and everywhere.

I'm afraid that alcohol will make drunk and eventually lose control of what I'm doing, and doing some extremely stupid stuff that I'll regret for ages. Also I'm afraid of any possible brain-damage.

Someone please convince me that alcohol isn't bad. :\

FYI; Alcohol at 16 is legal in my country.

op_title: Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring

&gt;convince me that alcohol isn't bad.

This is vague.  What precisely do you mean when you say that alcohol is "bad."  I'll assume that whe you say it is bad, what you mean is "I shouldn't drink alcohol."

While I'm not personally a huge drinker of alcohol, I think I can convince you that should sometimes drink it. 

The first thing to point out is that if you have only a little (~1 beer), it will not have much of an effect on you.  You might notice a small effect if you've never had it before, but you might not even notice it. In my experience, the effect of drinking one beer is probably comparable to the effect of eating one dose of chewable Tylenol. Maybe even less noticeable than that.

You might respond by asking "Why should I drink something that will have no appreciable effect on me?" The answer is, unfortunately, that sometimes you will be in situations (e.g. parties) where abstaining might bring attention onto you that you don't want. If you have a single drink and say that you've had enough after that, it will be decidedly less awkward. So this might mean you should drink in those situations. (Personally, I've gotten to the point where I no longer will have a drink just to fit in, but when I was 16, or 18, or 20, I definitely would do this.)

But what about having more than one drink? Well, clearly you should take things one step at a time (and from your description of yourself, I don't expect that you'd go out and do 10 shots this evening). But some people, many people in fact, quite like the feeling of being somewhat 'drunk.' It can make you more relaxed, more social. Some people who have social anxieties find that alcohol helps them to come out of their shell when they are with groups of people.

In sum, alcohol *is* bad in some ways, and it can be dangerous. But other times, it can be relatively benign, and in some situations, it can even be good!

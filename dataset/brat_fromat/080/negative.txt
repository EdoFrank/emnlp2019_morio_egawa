op_title: Alcohol is bad, please don't let me grow up boring

Well, you might want to try explaining why you think alcohol is bad in a little more detail, as I don't really have much to go off of here.

Basically, alcohol in moderation is a tool for making certain experiences more enjoyable.  There are different levels of intoxication.  It's not like there's a threshold you cross where you go from coherent and coordinated to stumbling baboon.  You can drink slowly and in moderation over the course of a night and just get enough alcohol in your system to have a "Buzz" going.  It lowers your inhibitions enough to make you more talkative, so social situations are either more fun, or easier to stomach depending on your point of view.  It produces a unique feeling which is enjoyable, so even if you're just watching Breaking Bad or reading a book by yourself it's still a fun activity.

You're 16, so I'm not going to recommend you start drinking, that's against the law, but alcohol isn't really something to be fearful of.  When you understand the effects of alcohol, if you're **responsible** about when you drink and how much you have, it is simply a tool to help you have a good time.

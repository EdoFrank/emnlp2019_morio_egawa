You unduly separate "women's decisions" and "discrimination". A woman's career choices can be affected by the judgments she expects from people. Even a simple "I want to help people" thought can automatically and unconsciously lead to teaching or nursing for a woman and being a doctor for a man. This is because of the lack of stereotype-breaking role models in children's lives.

Additionally you fail to ask why all those traditionally female roles are less well-paid. Teachers' pay is set centrally so it's not just the market (although if something is caused by the market that doesn't mean it's not caused by the patriarchy too). Why do we value things women want to do less than we value things men want to do?

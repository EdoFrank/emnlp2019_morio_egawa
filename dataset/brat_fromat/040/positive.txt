op_title: I think that the gender wage gap is due to the majority of women's decisions and not discrimination. CMV

I do think discrimination plays a (secondary) role, but let's leave that aside for a moment. I once read an essay on feminism (that I wish I could remember the author of to credit them) whose point was that if you care about fairness for men and women, what you should be asking yourself is not who is to blame for some perceived slights, but instead: if you were trying to make a society that's fair to men and women from scratch, how would you arrange it?

For instance, your claim is that women prefer worse-paying jobs. Is this an accidental quirk of biology? My guess is that it is not. Historical forces have shaped which jobs women are more likely to go into (for instance because they have more female mentors, because it's more socially accepted, etc.), and also which jobs are better paid. Is this how it should be arranged if you were making it up from scratch?

I really don't agree with a lot of feminists on a lot of issues, but I am very much in on the concept of the patriarchy as societal forces that enforce gender roles, that often are detrimental to both men and women. I think that is what is at play here.

T1	Value 58 124	I don't know who you are and what you have or haven't done in life
T2	Value 140 223	I cannot honestly tell you what your individual worth as a person may or may not be
T3	Value 225 258	I'm just some guy on the internet
T4	Value 294 400	"Worthy" and "significant" are human terms for human concepts that only exist relative to human perception
T5	Value 402 564	If you feel you are inherently "not worthy" due to the vast scale and general nature of the universe, etc., you have misunderstood the very nature of "worthiness"
T6	Value 566 703	To seek confirmation of some innately human value from the universe itself is inherently irrational, and inherently bound to be fruitless
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 705 802	It's about as rational as asking your kitchen table or an orange to assert your worth as a person
T8	Value 804 1109	Your kitchen table is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, an orange is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question, and the universe is not a thinking being and therefore cannot hold an opinion concerning your question
T9	Value 1112 1141	It's really as simple as that
T10	Value 1143 1236	You are looking for an absolute answer to a relative question, but things don't work that way
T11	Value 1238 1319	All your "worthiness" as a human being will have to be determined by human beings
T12	Value 1328 1404	"worthiness" is something that only exists in the perception of human beings
T13	Value 1406 1699	The very concept of "worthiness" is only one of the many mental tools evolution has equipped us with in order to be able to function as social beings within the context of a society (the ability to do so being, of course, a prerequisite for human survival for much of our history as a species)
T14	Value 1709 1832	it would be more convenient and more comfortable if there was some way to absolutely determine one's worth, but there isn't
T15	Value 1834 2032	You are therefore left with the task of determining - and more importantly, creating! - your own worth, which might of course be a little cumbersome, but that is simply the nature of human existence
T16	Value 2034 2046	Such is life
T17	Policy 2048 2157	Keep your head up, keep a stiff upper lip and carry on, and enjoy the pleasures of life when they come to you
T18	Value 2159 2176	They generally do
T19	Policy 2178 2209	Just keep the following in mind
T20	Value 2212 2365	"Exists only relative to the perception of individual human beings" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as "does not exist in any way whatsoever"
T21	Value 2371 2516	"doesn't matter in some absolute, unmovable and universal way" is clearly and obviously not the same thing as "does not matter in any way at all"

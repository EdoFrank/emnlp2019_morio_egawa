op_title: I believe that I am worthless. CMV.

Well maybe that was a bit harsh, but I think I am insignificant. The universe is much bigger than anything a person can imagine; I don't think that anything I will ever do will matter because of this. This picture reaffirmed how I felt (http://imgur.com/vyOiKDu.) I am non-religious and I guess that might be part of why I feel this way (No personal god). One other thing to mention is my personal philosophy is close to Humanism. I have joined healthcare system and believe that helping my fellow man is as close to as being significant as I can. I still ultimately feel that nothing I will ever do will matter. So go ahead Reddit, CMV.

op_title: American universities spend too much money on their football teams. CMV

I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1nxbc4/great_look_at_college_football_equipment_infograph/) on /r/CFB the other day showing an infographic ([seen here](http://www.sparefoot.com/consumers/college-football-equipment-infographic/)) about how much American Universities spend to outfit their football teams. Apparently, schools like Auburn University and Ohio State University spend more than $35 million every year to outfit their football teams. The median spending per year on football equipment is $742,000 for NCAA Division 1 schools.

I feel like this is an exorbitant amount to spend on a sport, and does not align with the true purpose of a university. Many of these same universities are currently raising tuition on college students, pricing more people out of an education and increasing the debt burden that college students take on. Sure, a private university can go ahead and spend but they want on whatever, but when state universities do so I have a real problem with that.

Now, let me clarify that I'm not against sports in college, I just think that universities put too much money into the system. After all, most of that money ends up benefitting athletic outfitters like Nike. And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment. CMV.

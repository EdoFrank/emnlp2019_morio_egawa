T2	Testimony 93 418	I saw [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1nxbc4/great_look_at_college_football_equipment_infograph/) on /r/CFB the other day showing an infographic ([seen here](http://www.sparefoot.com/consumers/college-football-equipment-infographic/)) about how much American Universities spend to outfit their football teams
T3	Fact 432 558	schools like Auburn University and Ohio State University spend more than $35 million every year to outfit their football teams
T4	Fact 560 650	The median spending per year on football equipment is $742,000 for NCAA Division 1 schools
T5	Value 665 771	this is an exorbitant amount to spend on a sport, and does not align with the true purpose of a university
T6	Value 773 956	Many of these same universities are currently raising tuition on college students, pricing more people out of an education and increasing the debt burden that college students take on
T7	Value 964 1033	a private university can go ahead and spend but they want on whatever
T8	Value 1039 1100	when state universities do so I have a real problem with that
T9	Value 1128 1161	I'm not against sports in college
T10	Value 1181 1228	universities put too much money into the system
T11	Value 1241 1309	most of that money ends up benefitting athletic outfitters like Nike
T12	Value 1330 1375	many of these programs are in fact profitable
T13	Policy 1395 1502	those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment

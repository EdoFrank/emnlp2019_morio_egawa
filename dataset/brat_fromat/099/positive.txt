op_title: American universities spend too much money on their football teams. CMV

&gt;And I'm aware that many of these programs are in fact profitable, I just think that those profits should be put back into educational programs, and not into buying more fancy sports equipment.

That's not where the money goes though; equipment and training facilities are expensive, of course, but for the most part they're one-off expenses, and the profits more than cover that.  [Auburn might have spent more than $39 million, but they brought in more than $76 million.](http://college-sports.findthedata.org/q/63/3448/How-much-profit-does-the-Auburn-University-Football-team-in-Auburn-University-Alabama-make)

So where's the money go?  All the other athletics that DON'T make a massive profit, for starters.  Auburn has Golf, Track and Field, Hockey, Tennis, Volleyball, Soccer and a whole bunch of other sports that are almost costing more money to maintain than they earn.  But because the Football Program is so profitable, the college can easily afford to maintain these extracurriculars  for their students to enjoy.

As for the leftover money, that obviously goes to the school.  But if you or anyone you knew in college ever enjoyed playing any kind of sport on any level (Club, Intramural, Varsity, etc.), know that that option most likely wouldn't have been available if not for the Football (and possibly also the Basketball) Program.

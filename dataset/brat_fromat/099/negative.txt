op_title: American universities spend too much money on their football teams. CMV

Remember that many top athletic programs are paid for by athletic foundations, not the general university fund. This means that athletics are at least partially funded by private alumni donations.

In the university I support (SEC school), I make an annual donation to the athletic foundation, not to the general/alumni fund.  Our entire athletic program (including facilities) is paid for by private alumni donations and profits from football/basketball.  No university funding is required, thus there is no impact on tuition.

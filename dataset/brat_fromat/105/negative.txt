op_title: I think cyberbullying is BS, CMV

I think the idea that we're "babying" kids about cyberbullying is a little misplaced. I got bullied a little bit too but only maybe 5% of it was physical- bullying is really a psychological game. Combine this with the fact that the internet is a shield some people use to say awful things they wouldn't even say in real life and you have a new vehicle for insulting and intimidation that kids haven't had to deal with before. I know it can be hard to accept it as "valid" because it's not the situation we dealt with as kids but you have to realize how much has changed in the way kids talk to each other now. Instead of having to wait until after lunch or the corner of the playground at recess where the teacher can't see, these kids have smartphones and can say hurtful things from anywhere, any time of the day. Instead of a kid getting called a faggot at school once or twice a day he's getting facebook messages about how he should go kill himself. Cyberbullying is not only a real thing, it's a much more extensive platform for bullying than kids have ever really had to deal with before.

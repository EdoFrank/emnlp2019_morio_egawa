op_title: I think cyberbullying is BS, CMV

Like a lot of people, I was bullied all through school.  I understand that all of us are raised differently and not all of us are given the tools to deal with situations like these.  I just don't think babying the kids is fixing it.  It allows them to be a "victim".  I know they are victim's but I mean in the sense of that's the tools we are giving them to respond.  Aside from that, cyberbullying is even more BS.  Maybe I'm just stuck comparing my experience to the fact that the internet is not a "nice" place.  It just seems silly to think that when you add anonymity people won't be more cruel. At that point, it is literally JUST WORDS on a screen.  You can delete posts, block phone numbers, delete accounts...so many more ways to just "walk away".  Which is exactly what I and many others did when bullied in person.  

Edit:  Great discussion everyone!  Thanks for all your input!

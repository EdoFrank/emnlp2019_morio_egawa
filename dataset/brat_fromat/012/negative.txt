As a queer person, I appreciate that you're open-minded about this and recognize that your disgust isn't totally rational :)

It may help you to know that while your disgust is a gut reaction, it is also heavily culturally reinforced. The fact that it's still with you isn't totally your fault. I don't know what it's like to be a young guy in middle school/high school, but from I what I know about it there's a whole lot of pressure to *not be gay* in any way, shape, or form. Other guys liberally throw around phrases like "fag" and "that's so gay." 

Some other people are replying saying that they had similar reactions when meeting black people for the first time. However, since overt racism is generally frowned upon in society, that disgust isn't as culturally supported, and you can get over it easier. 

I'm willing to bet that the disgust will lessen over time, especially if you make an effort to just be around gay people and watch them be casually affectionate.

op_title: I am extremely pro-gay rights, but I think it's gross. Can you CMV?

Okay, I'm straight, but I find it disgusting and ridiculous we in the US are even having a debate about allowing gay men and women the same rights as everyone else.

I do however, find is wickedly gross when I see 2 guys kissing or touching each other. Maybe less for girls, which is clearly another double standard.

I don't want to view it that way, it makes me feel kind of shitty and I never bring it up because the few times that I have I get shitty looks and I've even been called homophobic for this. Obviously I'm not afraid or against homosexuality though.

So.. is there any arguments out there that can CMV?

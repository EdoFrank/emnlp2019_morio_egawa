op_title: I am extremely pro-gay rights, but I think it's gross. Can you CMV?

No, because what you're describing isn't a thought.  We can't reason with it.  What you're describing is your mind reacting to something it perceives as being out of the ordinary, incongruous with your own experience of the world.  I grew up in a country with no black people in it.  Literally none.  One day, I found myself in a small room with a black family.  I had never seen a black person up close before and certainly never been a minority.  I didn't find it "disgusting" but my palms sweat a little, my heart raced.  And I was so frustrated and embarassed by my reaction!  I had always been raised to believe that racism is a terrible thing.

The important thing is to distinguish between what your gut feels and what you believe to be right.  They aren't always the same thing.  People who cite gut feelings as support for their beliefs are to be treated with extreme distrust.

Also, maybe watch a whole load of vanilla gay porn, or all five series of Queer as Folk.  The exposure will probably get you over this reaction.

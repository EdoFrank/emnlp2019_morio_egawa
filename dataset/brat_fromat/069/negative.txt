op_title: I believe that Batman always wins the "who would win in a fight" game if he can escape the first fight. CMV.

Parallel and alternate universes are common in comics. If Batman fought an alternate universe Batman, either one would eventually lose or the fight would exist in a perpetual stalemate (in which case, neither wins and thus disproves the CMV statement). It seems plausible the "main" one might lose at some point, since some alternate Batmans seem to differ only ideologically and not necessarily in capability, like for example [Justice Lord Batman,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Justice_Lords.jpg).

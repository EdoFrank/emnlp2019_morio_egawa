op_title: I believe that Batman always wins the "who would win in a fight" game if he can escape the first fight. CMV.

The OP is actually much more clever than you all are giving her credit for

OP has only made a comment about what happens IF Batman can escape the first fight - so any crazy-powerful superbeing wins but is not relevant to the discussion.

What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and *become* insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count)

That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)

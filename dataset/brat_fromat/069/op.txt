op_title: I believe that Batman always wins the "who would win in a fight" game if he can escape the first fight. CMV.

Batman wins any fight in which he can escape the first battle, be it Marvel, DC, a dance-off with Freddie Mercury, whatever. I base this on a few things:

-Bruce Wayne has the funds and resources of an entire corporation, so in a pinch he can spend his way to finding a weakness like Lex Luthor. (I mean, what other superhero can spend millions on kryptonite arrows _just in case Superman goes berserk_?)

-He's a _freaking ninja_ with unparalleled training. If he gets into a fight or test of manual dexterity he can just study and learn the moveset of whatever needs done. (This is how he out-dances Freddie Mercury, obviously.

-He's a master detective. As soon as he gets back to the batcave he'd be analyzing tape and info from the first fight. Spiderman's got webs? Okay. Make a web-dissolving serum.

-The dude trains against a wide variety of villains all the time. The psychotic Joker, the cerebral Riddler, the raw power of Bane, the shifting form of Clayface... you name it, Batman's got experience scrapping against it.

In short: Batman beats up everybody. Light-hearted willingness to CMV here. Wow me with your comic book prowess.

**edit:** /u/ajfirecracker knocked this one out of the park, not to mention filling my mind with the horrific downfall of Batman to Cthulhu. Goddamn. Cthulhu would probably even let him go _on purpose_, just to watch Batman go insane trying to research an answer.

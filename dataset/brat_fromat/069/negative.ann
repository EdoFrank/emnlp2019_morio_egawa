T1	Value 130 183	Parallel and alternate universes are common in comics
T2	Value 185 381	If Batman fought an alternate universe Batman, either one would eventually lose or the fight would exist in a perpetual stalemate (in which case, neither wins and thus disproves the CMV statement)
T3	Value 383 441	It seems plausible the "main" one might lose at some point
T4	Value 449 645	some alternate Batmans seem to differ only ideologically and not necessarily in capability, like for example [Justice Lord Batman,](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ec/Justice_Lords.jpg)

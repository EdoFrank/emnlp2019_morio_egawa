T1	Value 130 204	The OP is actually much more clever than you all are giving her credit for
T2	Value 206 288	OP has only made a comment about what happens IF Batman can escape the first fight
T3	Value 294 328	any crazy-powerful superbeing wins
T4	Policy 369 622	What we really need is some sort of Lovecraftian villain that would allow Batman to escape the first fight, but which would nevertheless gradually take over and *become* insurmountable (maybe zombies, in general, although tbh I don't know if they count)
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 624 753	That, or somebody who reincarnates as a more powerful being (Phoenix?) or who could just outlast Batman (Hulk / Wolverine, maybe)

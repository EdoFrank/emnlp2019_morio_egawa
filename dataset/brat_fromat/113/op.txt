op_title: There should be limits on how much money a family can lose to a Casino within a certain time-period. CMV

A Casino just opened up near me, and it is HUGE! There are over 3,000 slots, 150+ tables, and tons of other games / VIP rooms; encompassing 260 acres. It's basically a Mega-Mall or adult Disney Land, and people are being drawn to it like flies to a light-bub. The worst part is that it is located in front of a major shopping center where thousands of locals do their daily shopping &amp; errands. It blows my mind when I think of how many families will be destroyed because the mother or father found an easy way to forfeit their incomes to gambling, alcohol, and expensive steaks. I have known half a dozen people, one of which personally, whose families were destroyed by gambling. By having Vegas styled Casinos in the middle of a suburb and in front of our shopping mall, our community will suffer.

The negative effects that gambling has on middle / lower class communities is extremely detrimental to their financial &amp; social stability; especially with how it stagnates their climb up the socioeconomic ladder. My argument is that: we should define or enforce limits on how much a single family can potentially lose to a Casino within a certain amount of time. I understand how difficult it would be to legislate this, and it may be better to use more subtle approaches; but I seriously believe that a compromise could be reached. The simplest way would be to disallow excessive losses based on whether or not you have claimed dependents on your taxes.

**Pros:** 

* Much of the "high" that addicts experience comes from the anticipation of their next win. It is the constant need for that gratification which drives their over-spending. As with drug addiction, when you delay the gratification along extended periods of time; addicts start finding better ways to focus their energy and attention. Of course, some will translate that desire to other addictions, but most realize that: "I'm doing just fine without it."

* ~~I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money.~~ MVC.

* The first step to conquering addiction is to admit that there is a problem. Casinos do the EXACT opposite, though, as they mask the reality with free booze and the constant lure of wealth. By at least recognizing the problem at the source, I believe more attention will be brought to the issues. Even if it's just as ineffective as the "Smoking Causes Cancer" labels on cigarettes, it's still better than nothing.

**Cons:**

* By regulating the Casinos, you encourage the establishment of illegal operations. These are more damaging to a community. 

* Extremely difficult to legislate, and Casinos would fight it to the death; no matter what the compromise was.

* There may be other more effective ways to combat the problems associated with Casino culture, and this one would be controversial. 


[Here is a calculator](http://vegasclick.com/gambling/expectedloss.html) which shows the average expected losses per/hour. Who knows how accurate this is, but we do know that Casinos are very profitable. 

TL;DR: If someone has children, the amount of money they can lose while gambling should be limited. So as not to feed the socio-economic reality where 'the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer'.

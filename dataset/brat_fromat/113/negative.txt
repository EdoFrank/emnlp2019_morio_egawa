Gambling is an addiction. If a parent has an addiction to gambling, limiting their access isn't going to change the reality of their disease. It would be along the same logic of limiting the amount an alcoholic can drink; an alcoholic has a disease and 'limiting' won't change their desire to drink. 

Those with addiction will find a way to do these things, regardless of the amount of 'restrictions' you put in place.

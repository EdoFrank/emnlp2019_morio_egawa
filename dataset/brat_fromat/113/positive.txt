If you're going to follow that logic through you wind up restricting so many things that you might as well argue for universal state run orphanages. How would you even track this? Fingerprinting at the pull of every slot machine. 

I'd also like to point out that you don't know any families destroyed by gambling. You know families destroyed by family members.

Here is a compromise play. Have some kind legal system set up where it is actually really easy to initiate proceedings to have someone declared unfit to handle their finances and a guardianship is initiated. Things like detrimental gambling habit and alcoholism would be the kind of thing that one would have to prove for a loved one. Once that is done make it so that that guardian can have that person put on a "no play" list on file at the casino. 

&gt;I believe Casinos are borderline criminal. Anything to damage their ability to suck money out of hard-working people is O.K in my opinion. There are much better ways that we can invest our time &amp; money.

It is quite dangerous to advocate wielding the violence of the state just because activities among adults pisses you off and you think they could do better things with their time and money. Much better to devise a system where the percentage with some sort of addiction disorder can be locked out of the activity and taken care of.

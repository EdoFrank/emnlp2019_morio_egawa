op_title: I don't think there should be "attorney privelege" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge. CMV

What about if a person doesn't know if she's innocent or guilty? Say for example someone commits homicide but doesn't know if her particular homicide is considered a crime in her jurisdiction. She needs an attorney that will not disclose so she can learn whether she committed a crime in the first place. This is separate from the prosecutor's claim of criminal activity.

And the other issue is that when it comes to courts, people typically only want to reveal the personal/private information that is absolutely necessary for defense. Say for example the circumstances of the homicide involve a trade secret that, if made public, will financially ruin the defendant (even if the defendant is eventually found not guilty).

If you made it so that the attorney must reveal what happened, then why would any client risk their financial/personal/social status?

Also, the other issue is that it is NOT the attorney's job to determine whether someone is guilty. That is the judge's and/or jury's job. What you're asking is that attorney's decide whether or not someone is guilty of a crime... if so then why even have judges and/or juries in the first place?

Another issue is that when you give people a chance to reach an attorney, that makes them more likely to stay within the system of government. If criminals feel that they have a chance of getting away free, they're more likely to turn themselves in than to hide out or continue to commit more crimes.

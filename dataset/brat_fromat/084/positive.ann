T1	Rhetorical_Statement 164 228	What about if a person doesn't know if she's innocent or guilty?
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 229 355	Say for example someone commits homicide but doesn't know if her particular homicide is considered a crime in her jurisdiction
T3	Value 357 467	She needs an attorney that will not disclose so she can learn whether she committed a crime in the first place
T4	Value 469 534	This is separate from the prosecutor's claim of criminal activity
T5	Value 541 700	the other issue is that when it comes to courts, people typically only want to reveal the personal/private information that is absolutely necessary for defense
T6	Value 718 887	the circumstances of the homicide involve a trade secret that, if made public, will financially ruin the defendant (even if the defendant is eventually found not guilty)
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 890 1023	If you made it so that the attorney must reveal what happened, then why would any client risk their financial/personal/social status?
T8	Value 1031 1122	the other issue is that it is NOT the attorney's job to determine whether someone is guilty
T9	Fact 1124 1161	That is the judge's and/or jury's job
T10	Value 1163 1251	What you're asking is that attorney's decide whether or not someone is guilty of a crime
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1255 1320	if so then why even have judges and/or juries in the first place?
T12	Value 1322 1463	Another issue is that when you give people a chance to reach an attorney, that makes them more likely to stay within the system of government
T13	Value 1465 1621	If criminals feel that they have a chance of getting away free, they're more likely to turn themselves in than to hide out or continue to commit more crimes

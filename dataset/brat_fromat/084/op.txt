op_title: I don't think there should be "attorney privelege" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge. CMV

I'm posting in CMV because I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area at all, but I hold this controversial view. I am open to learning about why this privelege exists.

While I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you, I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone. People will explain this by saying, "hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway, just have trust in the system". But the system isn't foolproof, and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime! I don't understand the system at all. Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets, and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict, so why have this rule?

All this rule helps are the bad guys. The good guys aren't benefiting from this, because they (usually) wouldn't admit to something to begin with. This rule is only in place for the sake of "the system" and I don't know how good that system is. To know that there could be murders set free that would be in prison now if this rule wasn't in place is unsettling to say the least.

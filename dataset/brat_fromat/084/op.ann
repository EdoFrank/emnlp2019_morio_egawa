T1	Major_Claim 20 162	I don't think there should be "attorney privelege" and that attorneys should be able to tell the court if their client admits to a charge. CMV
T2	Testimony 191 242	I don't have a lot of knowledge in this area at all
T3	Testimony 248 278	I hold this controversial view
T4	Testimony 280 333	I am open to learning about why this privelege exists
T5	Value 342 401	I understand that a defense attorney is there to defend you
T6	Value 403 520	I don't see how making it illegal for defense attorneys to say when their client admits to a charge is helping anyone
T7	Value 522 644	People will explain this by saying, "hopefully the courts figure out that he did it anyway, just have trust in the system"
T8	Value 650 818	the system isn't foolproof, and I don't know how defense attorneys can live with themselves knowing that they are defending someone who should be charged with the crime
T9	Value 820 856	I don't understand the system at all
T10	Policy 858 973	Attorneys shouldn't be forced to keep these awful secrets, and we all want the bad guys to get their proper verdict
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 978 997	why have this rule?
T12	Value 999 1035	All this rule helps are the bad guys
T13	Value 1037 1078	The good guys aren't benefiting from this
T14	Value 1088 1144	they (usually) wouldn't admit to something to begin with
T15	Value 1146 1242	This rule is only in place for the sake of "the system" and I don't know how good that system is
T16	Value 1244 1376	To know that there could be murders set free that would be in prison now if this rule wasn't in place is unsettling to say the least

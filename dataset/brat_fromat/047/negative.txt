op_title: I believe abortion is not pro-choice in the sense that the baby itself is not the woman's body. CMV!

A fetus requires a lot of resources from the woman's body which it acquires through the placenta. A large part of the placenta is the woman's  body which induces a lot of change. So if it helps, think of pro choice as choosing whether or not to maintain a part of your own body: the placenta.

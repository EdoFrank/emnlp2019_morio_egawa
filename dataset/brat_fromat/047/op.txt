To be clear, I'm not hear to discuss whether abortion is right or wrong as there are many more sides to that matter than just a woman's right to her body.

I just believe that a fetus is a separate entity from the woman, it having a separate DNA for example, that the fate of the fetus is not part of a woman's right to her own body, being that is isn't actually wholly her body.

Am I wrong in thinking this? I'd like to know.

Again, let us refrain from discussing abortion itself as right or wrong as that is not what I want to discuss here. I believe there are many other arguments for and against abortion and in practical terms, what I want to discuss may mean little, but I would like to come to a better understanding of this particular argument.

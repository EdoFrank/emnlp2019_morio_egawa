T1	Major_Claim 20 120	I believe abortion is not pro-choice in the sense that the baby itself is not the woman's body. CMV!
T2	Value 135 275	I'm not hear to discuss whether abortion is right or wrong as there are many more sides to that matter than just a woman's right to her body
T3	Value 298 500	a fetus is a separate entity from the woman, it having a separate DNA for example, that the fate of the fetus is not part of a woman's right to her own body, being that is isn't actually wholly her body
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 503 531	Am I wrong in thinking this?
T5	Value 558 665	let us refrain from discussing abortion itself as right or wrong as that is not what I want to discuss here
T6	Value 677 755	there are many other arguments for and against abortion and in practical terms
T7	Value 801 875	I would like to come to a better understanding of this particular argument

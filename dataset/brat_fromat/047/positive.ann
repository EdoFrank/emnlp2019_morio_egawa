T1	Value 122 301	Aborting a fetus which is not viable is choosing to remove life support, a choice granted to the host of life support due to the fetus not being an independent and competent adult
T2	Value 303 498	Doing this via abortion could be compared to an overdose of morphine rather than pulling the plug and letting the entire existence of the fetus off life support be a much slower and certain death
T3	Value 500 557	This would also be the choice of the host of life support
T4	Value 560 698	If the fetus is not a part of the woman's body, then she may remove from her body that which is not a part of her at any time she sees fit
T5	Value 700 804	This is not a matter of abortion as much as it is a right to remove what is not your body from your body

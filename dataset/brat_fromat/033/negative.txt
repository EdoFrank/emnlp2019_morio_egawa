op_title: I believe that the NoFap movement is harmful to men's health, as well as their relationships with women. CMV.

I am sorry but I thought that NoFAp was for a short period of time and the purpose is clearly defeined as "to casually participate in a NoFap week or monthly challenge as a test of self control, or if fapping (or pornography!) has become an addictive problem in your life". I highly doubt that anybody would not be able to understand the difference between real sex and a porn video. NoFap is just a game of self-control as far as I see it, there really should no affect of NoFap on how you see women or sex.

op_title: I believe that the NoFap movement is harmful to men's health, as well as their relationships with women. CMV.

The health benefits of masturbation are myriad, [from reducing cancer risks to improving mental health].  The external benefits, including better sexual performance and a healthier attitude towards sex, are also myriad.  


I believe that the NoFap movement is destructive in the same way that any abstinence movement is: it enshrines the thing it's banning in such a way as to empower it beyond what's realistic.  I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex.


I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic.  I believe that NoFap is destructive to the way men see women as they are placing desires that would otherwise be explored through pornography in other human beings, thus elevating them to standards that they will never meet, damaging the way men interact with women.


Yes, I understand that the same argument can be flipped by saying that pornography reduces women to dangerous archetypes, too, but I don't buy that argument: Vin Diesel is always a bad ass every time I see him on a screen, but I don't really think he could fuck anyone up, because I can differentiate between performance and reality.   


And finally, I believe that NoFap is an excuse for insecure men to blame their own sexual desires and personal inadequacies for the fact that they can't speak to women.  I believe that it's creating a fake solution for a real problem, and creates much worse problems as a result.


**TL;DR: The NoFap movement is destructive and counterproductive to a man trying to be confident and trying to have healthy relationships with women.  CMV.**

I may be able to change your view through actions. What is the longest period that you have abstained from porn and masturbation together?

I'm currently sitting at ~12 days, and my sex drive is up. I used to be mainly attracted to women in porn, but now I feel like I want to have sex with (almost) any woman.

By the way, you have a misconception regarding what NoFap is about. NoFap is about abstaining from porn, not fapping. It's *porn* that messes you up, not masturbation. You were built for (occasional) physical stimulation, but you were *most certainly not* built for porn. In one porn session, you are "having sex" with more women than your ancestors even saw fully clothed in their entire lifetimes. 

We abstain from fapping as well because fapping often leads to porn because our brains have connected fapping with porn. Once the porn addiction has been eliminated, you can begin fapping again if you want to.

Porn is an addiction, and an extreme one at that. So I ask you again, what is your current record for abstience from porn and masturbation together?

op_title: I believe there is nothing wrong with urinating in public. CMV.

Urinating in public can mean doing it in the middle of times square or doing it behind a bush off of a road with low traffic.

If i'm sitting on the beach, enjoying the view with my family, I by no means want to see anybody relieving themselves where they will. 

Understand this, though. If i'm at the beach and I notice you urinating behind a rock or something that provides adequate coverage, I won't bat an eye and I will carry on with my day.

Society is not comfortable with nudity. That is why pornography is frowned upon (mostly) and why there are specific beaches in only certain countries that you can go while nude. Parents think that it is some horrendous, scarring thing if their children sees a penis or nipple, so those children grow up having the same opinion.

I think the solution to this problem is to redefine the definition of "public urination". Urinating in a bush with noone around? You're fine. You stop on the sidewalk and relieve yourself? You get a ticket.

op_title: I believe there is nothing wrong with urinating in public. CMV.

I believe that laws banning urinating in public are based on 19th century moral values, and discriminate against those with small bladders.

I live in London, and I've often had to stagger home from a night out  for over an hour on the tube. Even if I empty my bladder before I leave, it's entirely likely that I'll need to go again before I reach my final stop. Unfortunately, there's often no choice when caught short on public transport, or waiting for a bus late at night, so I'll have to have a piss on a tree, or in a drain, or a dark corner somewhere. However, I know that if a policeman caught me, I could face an Â£80 on-the-spot fine.

Now, I'll concede that urine doesn't smell particularly nice, but that shouldn't be a problem if public urinators take a little time to pee on soil down a manhole or whatever.

Urine is perfectly sterile, and poses no health risk. Furthermore, I would argue that complaints about having to look at someone weeing (and possibly catching sight of their genitalia) are as immature and repressive as opposing public breastfeeding.

And also, would you rather I took a leak on a tree, or that I pissed my pants on the train?

Ladies and gentlemen, please change my view.

doktatogun made some very good points against it from a medical point of view. Considering that, you surely understand the laws. Of course you peeing in public is not gonna hurt anybody, but when everybody starts doing it, it's a different story. Great analogy here would be Egypt where it is prohibited to take sand as a souvenir. Sounds ridiculous at first but considering the masses of tourists they have it's quite understandable.

However, just passing a law like that is like telling people like you (and me, I know your problems only too well) to go fuck themselves. Thus whilst passing this law is acceptable there has to be some kind of 'alternative' to be provided, I think. Take Amsterdam for example: they have public 'urine walls' with a little privacy fence of the height of your head. Great solution in my opinion (not really applicable for women, though). Call your representative and tell him about these?

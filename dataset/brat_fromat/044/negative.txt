op_title: I do not believe in the existence of a "soul" CMV

Sorry, but you *do* believe in a soul, and here's why.

Imagine the world after your death.  What do you see?  You might imagine people at your funeral, or other people in the world going about their business after you've passed away.  But here's the thing: you still imagined *yourself seeing it*.  You imagined your consciousness, existing in a metaphysical state after your body had gone.

Now, you could argue, "But I imagined my *present* consciousness looking at *future* events!"  It doesn't matter.  For a true materialist, imagining an overlap between your own perception and the absence of your body should be impossible, like asking a person to imagine being blind and seeing the color red.  Your mind can't wrap itself around that concept.  But your mind can easily wrap itself around the concept of your consciousness existing without your body.  That's because deep down, you really believe that your consciousness is a *thing* in and of itself, not a process or a function of your physical form.  And if you believe your consciousness is a separate thing, then you believe that your perception of the world comes from a metaphysical entity which could, in theory, survive the destruction of your physical body.  In other words, a soul.

Now, what you *don't* believe is that *other people* have souls.  It's easy to imagine a world without other people.  But you believe that you have one, because everything you imagine has to pass through the filter of your own perception, even the imagining of your own death.

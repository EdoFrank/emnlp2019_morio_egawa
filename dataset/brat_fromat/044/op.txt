op_title: I do not believe in the existence of a "soul" CMV

While I think there are some arguments that make a compelling case for the possibility of God's existence I don't see the same as being true for the soul. The soul being some immortal, metaphysical, part of me that transcends death and more importantly that retains some form of identity. Once I die I don't think that there is any strong argument to claim that some aspect of me goes on living and that effects the world in any more meaningful way than the simple return of the elements of my makeup to the earth.
This is my first post so if it is not quite to CMV's standards I apologize

Thank you all so much for your replies, I wanted to make one clarification that what I am looking for is a strong inductive argument for a souls existence (or deductive but I don't think that's possible).

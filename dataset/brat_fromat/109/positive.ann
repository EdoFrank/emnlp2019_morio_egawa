T1	Value 57 96	I just see it as part of your hairstyle
T2	Value 98 153	It's just part of the hair that grows on your head, man
T3	Value 155 288	Growing a beard (or rather, not shaving it off) is no less weird than deciding how long, or what style you like the rest of your hair
T4	Value 299 392	there is also a lot to be said about how our culture has decided that shaving is the standard
T5	Value 408 511	when you stop shaving you have suddenly "started growing" a beard, as if you weren't already doing that
T6	Value 517 575	I'm not articulate or smart enough to really dig into that
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 577 689	Does the reason you dislike beards have something to do with seeing them as somehow *different* than other hair?
T8	Value 700 770	I don't think it is really about people *liking* or *disliking* beards
T9	Value 780 820	it's more that they just don't mind them

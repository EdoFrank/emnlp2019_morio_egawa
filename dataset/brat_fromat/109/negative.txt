op_title: I think beards are disgusting. CMV

1. My face looks better with a beard. That is a matter of preference. 

2. Initially I started because I was too lazy to shave, then I got used to having facial hair, then it felt weird without any facial hair. 

3. I also dont like long gandalf style beards, I dont think most people do, but a well-groomed, short beard looks nice on most people. There is nothing gross about it, unless there are food particles and/or dead things in there, it shouldn't elicit a 'gross' response.

4. A lot of time insecurities about beards stem from ones own incapability of growing a proper beard. I don't know, maybe its a subconscious dislike of beards since you don't like your own. 

4. Also there is the common stigma of beards being associated with pride and "manliness" in some cases its true as men are the only ones that can grow beards, but most of the time its not a primary reason for having a beard.

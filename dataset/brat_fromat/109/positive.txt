op_title: I think beards are disgusting. CMV

I just see it as part of your hairstyle. It's just part of the hair that grows on your head, man. Growing a beard (or rather, not shaving it off) is no less weird than deciding how long, or what style you like the rest of your hair.

I guess there is also a lot to be said about how our culture has decided that shaving is the standard, and therefor, when you stop shaving you have suddenly "started growing" a beard, as if you weren't already doing that, but I'm not articulate or smart enough to really dig into that. Does the reason you dislike beards have something to do with seeing them as somehow *different* than other hair?

Overall, I don't think it is really about people *liking* or *disliking* beards. I think it's more that they just don't mind them.

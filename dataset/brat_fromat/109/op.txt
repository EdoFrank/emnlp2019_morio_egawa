op_title: I think beards are disgusting. CMV

I have friends who have huge beards that they're incredibly proud of, and every time I see them I think it's just gross. Whether the well-groomed, short type or the long lumberjack-y growth, beyond the stubble stage it's all kind of weird to me. Nothing about them seems manly or rugged. 

I've heard a variety of responses to my view - some agree, some think that I'm going against some unspoken tenet of manliness. I've been most surprised to hear women that find unkempt, large beards attractive. 

I'm a man and I can't imagine doing it. I've bypassed the stubble stage into light beard territory before but I always reach a point where I start being bothered by it. What's so great about it? Why are people attracted to them? Why do people want to grow them? CMV.

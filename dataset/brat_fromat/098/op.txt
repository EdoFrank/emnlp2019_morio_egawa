op_title: I believe men shouldn't be expected to put the toilet seat down for women. CMV

It is considered common courtesy that when men finishes his business in the restroom, he has to put the seat back down for the ladies. In fact, many men are chastised and criticized for not doing this. 

This entire social "courtesy" seems absurd to me. We are continually working to level the playing field for women in society, and women and men alike often get offended when women are treated like dainty, delicate creatures who can't get their hands dirty. This is an archaic view of femininity that was used as a reason to deny the vote, women at work, and other socially and politically limiting rights for women. 

Expecting men to put the toilet seat down for women perpetuates inequality and this idea that women are too feminine to adjust a toilet seat. Men have to grab and raise the seat to use the restroom, and then touch it to put it back down again. Again, it's not so much the effort men have to exert, but about the symbolic gesture it sends towards our attitude of women. Men must do the dirty work for the women, and women can't get their hands dirty. 

If the toilet seat expectation were simply for aesthetic reasons, I probably wouldn't care so much, but the argument continually asserted for why the toilet seat must be put down by men is often that there "are women in the house/office." All I think it does it perpetuate age old sexism and views of femininity, and it is an outdated social custom that needs to be abolished for the good of all humanity. Change my view.

**EDIT**: I mean just the seat, not the lid. The lid closes the entire toilet from use, the seat is what you sit on. I'm talking specifically about the seat of the toilet.

**EDIT 2:** Shout out to [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1o24hh/i_believe_men_shouldnt_be_expected_to_put_the/cco736j) by /u/Internomer for changing my view. 

I'll post here what I replied to him: 

Before you take this post too seriously: yes, I know it's only a fucking toilet seat, and no one is actually getting hurt/being sexist, but it's the theoretical/logical component behind it that I'm addressing. This original post was written in a kind of tongue-in-cheek fashion, with some broader, somewhat legitimate points being made. It wasn't supposed to legitimately piss anyone off, just create a friendly debate surrounding the custom.

But anywho, shout out to /u/Internomer for chaning my view.

This argument, one of choice, is the best answer I've heard, and it wins my support.

Logically, leaving the seat how you left it means each person, male or female, has to exert energy the same amount of energy each time, either putting the seat up or putting the seat down depending on gender. This is all based on the assumption that a man must put a toilet seat up in order to urinate.

But /u/Internomer rightly points out that a man can choose to urinate sitting down or standing, and taking this presumption into account, neither person of either gender would have to do any work because the seat would be down at all times.

I also think it addresses the sexism aspect. A man exercising his choice to stand rather than sit is fine, as long as his choice does not infringe on the woman's necessity to sit. Should a man flaunt his privilege by leaving the seat up when he just as easily could have peed sitting down, I think he is inflicting harm upon the women.

While there could still be a radical feminist argument lambasting a man for feeling compelled to put the seat down because he is sympathetic towards a woman's lack of privilege that a man has with his choice of sitting or standing, I think that's taking things too far.

This argument wins!

T1	Testimony 100 203	I recently changed my own view on this from yours to the view that actually, I should put the seat down
T2	Value 228 262	Men can choose to stand, or to sit
T3	Value 264 410	Both valid options, though many men would tell you (due to some ridiculous idea about 'masculinity' or something) that it's standing only as a guy
T4	Value 412 432	You can stand or sit
T5	Testimony 434 545	Sometimes, I choose to sit - it certainly minimises the risk of a disobedient member blasting the rim with piss
T6	Value 549 577	Women don't have that choice
T7	Value 579 607	Every time, they have to sit
T8	Value 614 670	you're in the position of having the privelege of choice
T9	Value 812 835	the reverse is not true
T10	Value 1043 1191	It's not about empowerment or perpetuating inequality, it's about recognising that the privelege of choice is yours, not theirs - so don't be a dick
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1226 1398	a house of 2 men will need to lift and lower the seat depending on their preferences and due to the fact that you can't poop standing up (unless you're incredibly talented)
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1400 1443	A house of 2 women will never lift the seat
T13	Rhetorical_Statement 1448 1600	if you moved each of those people into a house together, the rule 'leave the seat down when you're done' means nobody has to change their seat awareness
T14	Value 1701 1756	Which seems, to me, to be the most fair way of doing it

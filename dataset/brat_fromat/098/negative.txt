op_title: I believe men shouldn't be expected to put the toilet seat down for women. CMV

&gt;Men must do the dirty work for the women, and women can't get their hands dirty.

How is it fair that you lift the seat but don't have to replace it back into the position it was in when you found it?  It's not about men having to do the dirty work for women, it's about men doing their own dirty work that they created themselves.  Men are not forced to stand to pee.  They have the choice to sit if they don't want to lift the seat.   

It's one thing if you have a place that you don't share with other people, or you live in a house with all guys who don't need the seat down but once a day or so for a BM, but otherwise, you're basically asking other people to clean up after you.  Clean up after yourself.

I recently changed my own view on this from yours to the view that actually, I should put the seat down. My thinking was this:

Men can choose to stand, or to sit. Both valid options, though many men would tell you (due to some ridiculous idea about 'masculinity' or something) that it's standing only as a guy. You can stand or sit. Sometimes, I choose to sit - it certainly minimises the risk of a disobedient member blasting the rim with piss. 

Women don't have that choice. Every time, they have to sit. 

So you're in the position of having the privelege of choice. Every time you choose to pee with the seat up, you're forcing the next occupant of that loo (if female) to put the seat back down. However, the reverse is not true; if a woman leaves the seat down, you are presented with a choice - lift it and pee standing up, or keep it down and sit (or risky option number three, pee through the reduced-area target of a down seat). 

It's not about empowerment or perpetuating inequality, it's about recognising that the privelege of choice is yours, not theirs - so don't be a dick.

Another way to think about it - a house of 2 men will need to lift and lower the seat depending on their preferences and due to the fact that you can't poop standing up (unless you're incredibly talented). A house of 2 women will never lift the seat. So if you moved each of those people into a house together, the rule 'leave the seat down when you're done' means nobody has to change their seat awareness - the men have to raise or lower it from time to time, and are aware of that, but the women do not. Which seems, to me, to be the most fair way of doing it.

T1	Major_Claim 20 75	I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV.
T2	Fact 77 365	Recent legislation has passed in Wales to require people who do not want their organs to be donated on their death to [opt out of the system](http://news.sky.com/story/1110361/organ-donation-wales-set-to-approve-opt-out) rather than the current system where they have to opt in if they do
T3	Value 382 419	this is a step in the right direction
T4	Value 430 454	it doesn't go far enough
T5	Policy 471 568	all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die
T6	Value 614 749	from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death
T7	Value 751 967	If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body
T8	Value 969 1040	If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver
T9	Value 1043 1108	I don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 1118 1235	what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so?
T11	Value 1236 1353	If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder
T12	Value 1356 1408	I can only see positives to mandatory organ donation

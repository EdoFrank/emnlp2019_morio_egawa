op_title: I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV.

Recent legislation has passed in Wales to require people who do not want their organs to be donated on their death to [opt out of the system](http://news.sky.com/story/1110361/organ-donation-wales-set-to-approve-opt-out) rather than the current system where they have to opt in if they do. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but that it doesn't go far enough. I believe that all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die.

I believe this for a few reasons. Firstly, from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death. If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver.

I don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so? If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder.

I can only see positives to mandatory organ donation. CMV.

*Edit: Your replies have me convinced. Thanks. Opt-out organ donation is the way to go. Opt in leaves too few organs, whereas mandatory donation upsets a metric fuckton of people for a huge number of reasons.*

op_title: I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV.

Probably late, but just to add, my organs are shit. I have complicated medical issues that have damaged my organs, muscles, and skin. I can't donate blood either, because it could kill the person. I HAVE to be able to opt out of organ donation, because my conditions are not things doctors would test a transplant organ for, normally. Unless I grow sick, have to stay in the hospital a while, and then die, the doctors wouldn't know, and they would kill someone with my organs. [Mainly with my blood] If I got in a car accident for example, and was pronounced dead at the scene, but the other person needed a kidney ASAP, what doctor wouldn't want to put my kidney in them? It LOOKS healthy. Opting out is my way of preventing people from dying.

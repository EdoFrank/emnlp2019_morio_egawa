op_title: I believe that organ donation should be mandatory. CMV.

If you are arguing simply based upon a utilitarian standpoint, think of this scenario: you have 3 individuals at a hospital that are going to die if they do not receive an organ transplant. One needs a new heart, one needs a new kidney, and one needs a new liver. Now down the hall there is a perfectly healthy man who has all 3 of these organs. Would not the utilitarian perspective be that we kill this individual to save the other 3 lives. Greatest good for the greatest number. Now this doesn't seem right does it? Individual consent is necessary from a moral standpoint. Professor Michael Sandel has a great series of lectures on this topic. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBdfcR-8hEY Having mandatory organ donation would incentive murder and would cause society to put more emphasis towards this organ donation, rather than to what I believe would be the most practical method: increase the advancement of biomedical engineering and artificial organs.

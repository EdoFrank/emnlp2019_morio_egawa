op_title: I believe people should not be allowed to bring babies in a movie theater except if it's a special "everybody can bring their babies" showing/theater. CMV

People pay a lot of money ($30+ for two tickets and a pop to share for me and the wife) to have a bit of an escape from day-to-day life for a few hours. The experience is is enjoyable when someone so much as texts or talks during the movie...it is a downright miserable experience if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside or thinking "hey I'm probably ruining everybody's experience, I'll just cut my losses and go home".

I think theater chains should refuse patrons with babies unless it's a rated G movie. Empire Theatres in Canada has a "Reel Babies" showing for certain movies so parents can take their babies and not worry about disturbing others.

I don't care if you really, really want to see the new Hobbit movie or whatever. I don't care if you can't find a baby sitter...those are the sacrifices you have to make when you have kids. Your wanting to see a movie does not entitle you to ruin everyone else's experience that they paid money for. Wait till the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out or see movies at special "everyone can bring their babies" showings.

op_title: I believe people should not be allowed to bring babies in a movie theater except if it's a special "everybody can bring their babies" showing/theater. CMV

&gt;if someone brings their baby and it either starts making cooing noises or starts crying *and the parent either does nothing or tries to get the baby to stop crying while still in the theater instead of taking it outside*

So this is the real problem. The part about babies is a red herring - if *anyone* is being disruptive, they should leave the theater. You don't need any sort of ban beyond that. Annoying people who talk through movies don't need a special ban. Slightly older kids that still throw tantrums don't need a ban. *Everyone* just needs to STFU in the theater, and leave (with parents if necessary) if they make noise.

As a parent, we usually get a babysitter but we brought our baby to the theater on a couple instances when we were pretty sure he would sleep through it. We sat by the aisle near the exit. If he woke up and started making even the smallest noise, one of us was instantly out of there with him. The two of us saw different halves of Hunger Games because we were trading off with the baby in the hall.

TL;DR: responsible parents don't need a ban in order to not bother other people, and inconsiderate assholes will always be inconsiderate regardless of what you ban.

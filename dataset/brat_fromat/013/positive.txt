op_title: I believe people should not be allowed to bring babies in a movie theater except if it's a special "everybody can bring their babies" showing/theater. CMV

When my twins were a week and a half old we took them along with us and our older two kids to see Cars 2. They each fussed for about a second when it was feeding time, but then we gave them their bottles and they shut up, ate and slept through the movie. When the movie was done the people that we were near said to us they didn't even realize that we had the babies with us. 
I think banning anyone is a stupid idea. But everyone needs to be respectful of other patrons. If one or both of my babies had been fussy and inconsolable I would have taken them out of the theatre immediately. If my older kids started being disruptive I would have taken them out of the theatre and given them an earful (cause they should know better).
Edit: I wouldn't bring a toddler to the movies. That's just a terrible idea.

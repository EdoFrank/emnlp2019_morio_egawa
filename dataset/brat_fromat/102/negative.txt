It's up to the couple and the mutual intent of the relationship.

There is more than one type of relationship and none of them are asinine.

Relationships range from one night stands to monogamous marriage and everything in between.

Want monogamy? Find someone who wants monogamy.

Don't want monogamy? Don't get into a monogamous relationship.

I personally don't want sex with anyone but my love. If she wants sex with other people it's fine, but it's a sign that we have different goals and feel different about each other. If she values sex with other people over what we have together than the relationship is over. If we don't have the same goals and the same perspective on monogamy then we probably shouldn't plan on being together for very long.

Some people like swinger parties, casual sex with strangers and having fuck buddies. Some people have sex for a living and still manage to have meaningful relationships. It's just a matter of your personal relationship and what your goals are as a couple.

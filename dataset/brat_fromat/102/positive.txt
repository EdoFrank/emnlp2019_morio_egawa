Monogamy is meaningful to many people. It's a symbol of commitment to each other. I don't have sex with other people, not because my husband is controlling or possessive, but because I've promised not to have sex with anyone but him. If I did and he got upset, it would be because I've broken that promise. It would be the same in reverse. 

Relationships are frequently about commitments to each other. It makes me happy that my husband and I have something so special that we don't share it with anyone else. The fact that we don't have sex with other brings us closer together. It wouldn't make either of us happy to cheapen that. 

And ultimately, if people are happy being monogamous, who are you to tell them that they shouldn't be?

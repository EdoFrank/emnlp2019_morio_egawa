op_title: I think sexual exclusivity in the age of birth control is asinine. CMV.

If my partner wants to spend his or her free time (time that wouldn't be devoted to our partnership anyway) having safe sex (no pregnancy or STIs) with someone else, why should I interfere? And if my partner discovers that being with that someone else more of the time makes them happier, I should be glad that they are happier. Otherwise I'm just being selfish and possessive.

In older times, when sex could easily mean babies or disease, having it with someone else could really damage your ability to fulfill your responsibilities to your partner. Today, sex can be safe and recreational. If a man finds out that his girlfriend had a great time and got laid after going out with the girls last night, he should be happy for her. If he doesn't value her happiness, why is he in a relationship with her? If he does value her happiness, why would he limit her pursuit of it as long as that pursuit doesn't limit his own?

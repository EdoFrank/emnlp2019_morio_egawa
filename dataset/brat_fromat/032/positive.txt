op_title: I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV?

Just because the bad feelings are fueled by anger at Monsanto doesn't mean it is conspiracy nonsense. Genetic modification is not bad in and of itself. It actually works to strengthen crops and make them better for us. But the effects of widespread uniform use of GMOs are ultimately unsafe. Monsanto's practices (and genetic engineering in general) reduce biodiversity which leads to a very unstable system, where a single disease can immediately kill off all the crops everywhere or any change in climate could have disastrous effects. If you're growing crops you want to use the best genes that have been created. You aren't going to grow a sub-par version just so biodiversity doesn't take a hit. But when everyone does that, then we have a huge food crisis waiting to happen. Genetic engineering strengthens the individual parts but weakens the whole.

T1	Major_Claim 20 180	I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV?
T2	Value 182 285	Humans have been adapting the food we grow for as long as we've had the slightest knowledge of genetics
T3	Value 287 376	Everything from gene manipulation to selective breeding is a type of genetic modification
T4	Value 386 487	it's difficult if not impossible to buy any food humans haven't modified genetically to fit our needs
T5	Value 516 851	the bad press surrounding genetically modified food (or more accurately, food that has had its genes artificially manipulated in the lab, since that's the only type of GMO anyone seems to care about) is borne of foodies and conspiracy nuts, and fanned by everyone's hatred of Monsanto for their (admittedly terrible) business practices
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 856 899	What don't I know that I should about this?

op_title: I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV?

I think a key to your argument is that human-promoted natural breeding is the same as genetic engineering by unnatural methods like physically inserting a foreign gene in a way that would never happen by accident.  I don't think they're that comparable:

1. **GMO makes more changes happen faster.**  This is why it's valuable.  Some changes, like [glowing pigs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4605202.stm), may be pretty much impossible to selectively breed for because nothing like it exists already, but can be done by injecting genes in a way that would never happen naturally.  Great for getting good things to happen faster, but it can also make bad things happen faster too.

2. **Faster, more drastic change is more dangerous.**  This is simply common sense.  Would you rather eat the slightly redder tomato that has existed and been eaten in small numbers for centuries, but has been selectively bred to be more common; or the cool glowing tomato that was created in a lab last month and has never been tried by anyone?  Basically, the "guinea pig" factor is much higher with GMO foods.

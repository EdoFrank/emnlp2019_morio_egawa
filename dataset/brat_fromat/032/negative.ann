T1	Value 190 394	a key to your argument is that human-promoted natural breeding is the same as genetic engineering by unnatural methods like physically inserting a foreign gene in a way that would never happen by accident
T2	Value 397 434	I don't think they're that comparable
T3	Value 442 478	GMO makes more changes happen faster
T4	Value 483 508	This is why it's valuable
T5	Value 511 771	Some changes, like [glowing pigs](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4605202.stm), may be pretty much impossible to selectively breed for because nothing like it exists already, but can be done by injecting genes in a way that would never happen naturally
T6	Value 774 871	Great for getting good things to happen faster, but it can also make bad things happen faster too
T7	Value 879 924	Faster, more drastic change is more dangerous
T8	Value 929 956	This is simply common sense
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 959 1219	Would you rather eat the slightly redder tomato that has existed and been eaten in small numbers for centuries, but has been selectively bred to be more common; or the cool glowing tomato that was created in a lab last month and has never been tried by anyone?
T10	Value 1232 1285	the "guinea pig" factor is much higher with GMO foods

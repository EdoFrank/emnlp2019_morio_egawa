op_title: I think GMO's are not only safe, but that the controversy surrounding them is largely conspiracy nonsense fueled by anger at Monsanto's business practices. CMV?

Humans have been adapting the food we grow for as long as we've had the slightest knowledge of genetics. Everything from gene manipulation to selective breeding is a type of genetic modification, meaning it's difficult if not impossible to buy any food humans haven't modified genetically to fit our needs. I can't help but feel that the bad press surrounding genetically modified food (or more accurately, food that has had its genes artificially manipulated in the lab, since that's the only type of GMO anyone seems to care about) is borne of foodies and conspiracy nuts, and fanned by everyone's hatred of Monsanto for their (admittedly terrible) business practices. 


What don't I know that I should about this?

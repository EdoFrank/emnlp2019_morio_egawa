T1	Value 167 177	I disagree
T2	Value 179 233	Good psychology only observes and tests empirical data
T3	Value 243 339	what you may have a problem with are the theorized mechanisms behind those observations and data
T4	Value 342 469	Every scientific discipline that studies things about which little is known must rely on some degree of theoretical speculation
T5	Value 475 588	those speculations are always based on the best data available and are amenable to change as new data is obtained
T6	Value 590 726	There are plenty of phenomena in physics, astronomy, biology, chemistry, etc that have not been directly observed but have been inferred
T7	Value 735 826	the rest of the evidence we have collected points very strongly toward a certain conclusion
T8	Value 828 854	Psychology is no different
T9	Value 856 922	The object of study of psychology might be complex in a unique way
T10	Value 927 964	by no means is it impossible to study
T11	Value 967 1161	By repeatedly observing human behavior under very specific and constrained conditions, psychologists can narrow down the potential factors underlying a given behavior, often with great precision
T12	Value 1163 1370	Granted, at the end of the day, we call these theoretical psychological constructs things like motivation, self-esteem, depression, personality, and so on and it seems like you might have a problem with that
T13	Fact 1372 1465	There is no "thing" in the human body or brain that corresponds directly to one's self-esteem
T14	Value 1470 1541	I can see how some people might be skeptical of trusting such a concept
T15	Value 1547 1772	in a laboratory, and often in real life, experimenters can manipulate this thing we call self-esteem and predict the results with surprising accuracy based on the body of knowledge that psychological scientists have collected
T16	Value 1775 1941	You can take issue with the identification of psychological constructs and theoretical speculation in the field of psychology, many psychologists certainly do as well
T17	Value 1947 2066	I really don't think you can say that psychology is not a valid science because it can't observe or test empirical data
T18	Value 2068 2123	Good psychologists do nothing but empirical observation
T19	Value 2125 2226	As with all science, it's the interpretation of the results or empirical observation that gets tricky
T20	Value 2232 2312	especially so when studying something as complex as human cognition and behavior

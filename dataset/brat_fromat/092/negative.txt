op_title: I do not believe that Psychology is a valid science. CMV

Psychology uses the scientific method to try to understand the human mind, therefore it is a science. It's as simple as that.

Of course there have been many many wild, unfounded, speculative theories in the history of psychology, not to mention many failed attempts at finding evidence to support those theories - but at no stage have theories been accepted as psychological fact *without* evidence. This is the key.

Many people say that Economics is not a science because its theories are untestable - one can neither set up good experiments nor get good data by observing nature. This is certainly not the case with psychology. There have been many examples of psychological theories being proved/disproved by means of experimentation.

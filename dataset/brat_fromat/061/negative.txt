The allowance of amendments isn't the problem in the US political system.  Amendments play a valuable role in legislation, and they can improve many laws.

The problem is that the politicians involved choose to include unrelated things and their peers don't vote that shit down as stupid and unrelated.

Congress doesn't need to pass bills that are hundreds of pages long that none of the reps have read before they vote.  They don't need to accept amendments that aren't germane to the issue.  

They are making a choice to validate this behavior and to make laws in this way.  It's not the fault of the process.  It's the fault of the people involved in it, and it's the fault of voters for putting up with that shit for years and years.

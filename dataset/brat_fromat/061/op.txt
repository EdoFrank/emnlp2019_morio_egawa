op_title: I believe allowing unrelated topics to be part of the same bill is damaging to the legislative process. CMV

It is a common practice in the introduction of legeslation to include completely unrelated issues in an attempt to get them passed as part of the main issue. For example, one party might want to pass law A, but not law B. A second party wants to pass lab B, but not law A. So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws.

I find this disruptive to the process. By forcing politicians to weigh the merits of completely unrelated issues against each other, the consideration given to individual issues is diluted and good laws get shot down to avoid the passing of bad, or vise versa. Change My View. 

**EDIT:** My view has been changed. Thanks to /u/thedeeno for pointing out that this is how minority interests get their views noticed and pushed through despite little interest. Also to /u/floorberry for pointing out that this is a way to get around using a LOT of time on small and (to the greater body) unimportant topics such as relatively small allocations for infrastructure upkeep. /u/treseritops made a similar point very well. Also, thanks to /u/auandi for pointing out that the House *already* has a rule against this, but it's effectively castrated by the normal political structure.

T1	Value 129 153	It's actually beneficial
T2	Value 155 201	This is how minority interests get things done
T3	Value 204 443	Ignoring the practical problems that arise when we start creating arbitrary issue boundaries, a system where every issue is segmented would be a system dominated by majority interests and also a system where negotiating is severely limited
T4	Rhetorical_Statement 460 529	suppose a few states live in a particularly dry region of the country
T5	Rhetorical_Statement 531 612	These states might have a minority interest in, say, fresh water delivery systems
T6	Rhetorical_Statement 614 650	Suppose they need to build a new one
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 652 676	Answer this for yourself
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 678 726	Why would the majority fund a project like this?
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 731 757	Because they are generous?
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 761 796	Because it's the right thing to do?
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 800 843	Because they can get something in exchange?
T12	Value 845 952	By allowing 'unrelated' issues into bills, we give this minority interest leverage at the negotiating table
T13	Value 954 1050	They can effectively say: we can't support your bill unless we get traction on our issue as well
T14	Value 1065 1207	by giving them a stake at the table, we can make our bill, which may otherwise be irrelevant to the minority, something worth taking action on
T15	Value 1214 1331	this does NOT mean dry-state representatives can SAFELY vote NO on a bill when they don't get traction on their issue
T16	Value 1333 1487	A vote is a constantly evolving negotiation, where the public perception, public desire, majority interest, and minority interest are constantly balancing
T17	Value 1489 1584	Allowing bills to be open documents maximizes the issues that get weighed into this calculation
T18	Value 1594 1700	this is a good thing - even though is may be frustrating when your issue is blocked by some other interest
T19	Value 1715 1837	unrelated topics increase the leverage of minority interests and makes the original bill appealing to more counter parties

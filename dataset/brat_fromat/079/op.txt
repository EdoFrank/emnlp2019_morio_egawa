op_title: I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, CMV

To start with, I'll say that I do think of myself as atheist but I honestly do not care whether or not any god(s), deity(/ies), creator(s), etc. exist. **I'm specifically interested in the existence of some sort of afterlife, or some existence of the essence of myself (meaning a sense of self, a personality, maybe some level of memory) after my eventual death.** I feel that because the brain and the body are our sources of the sense of self, our memories, our evolving personality, all of our emotions and sensations, that the death of our brain means the total absence of what we identify as a particular someone. 

**Why I want to CMV**
I'm terrified of mortality and have been ever since I first realized I was going to die. I frequently get flashes of fear when I realize it's all real and I'm actually going to disappear one day, but most of the time I'm in a fairly comfortable denial about it (where I acknowledge its factual truth, but I'm not in an actual panic). 

**What I have already considered**
I have already read all the quotes about how we're lucky to have just be born, how we won't exist to experience it so there is nothing to be afraid of, that it is the same as before we were born and there was nothing troubling then so it shouldn't trouble us now, etc. I know that "energy isn't created or destroyed." I have read ["You Want a Physicist to Speak at your Funeral"](http://i.imgur.com/lxQ9g.jpg). I know that immortality could eventually become torture. I agree with euthanasia. I know there are reasons why people might prefer death. I know that having a limited amount of time makes it all more meaningful and beautiful. I know that I shouldn't worry about the inevitable, but should instead make use of the time I have. I know that there are ways to support science in their pursuit of longer lifespans, I know about cryonics, the idea of the singularity. I have read Andy Weir's "The Egg" (which was a good story). 

I list these things just so the comments don't fill up with this sort of answer, because I've feared death as long as I can remember and have found all of these ways to cope myself. I have thought carefully about each. 

I have tried to believe in various forms of afterlife, with my favorites being some sort of calming heaven-like existence (as described best on Buffy the Vampire Slayer-- *"Wherever I was, I was happy. At peace. I knew that everyone I cared about was all right. I knew it. Time didn't mean anything, nothing had form, but I was still me, you know? And I was warm and I was loved and I was finished. Complete. I don't understand about theology or dimensions, or any of it really. But I think I was in heaven."* ) and reincarnation where you get to be born as any living sentience throughout the universe(s?). I think if I could get myself to believe in either, it would be a great comfort. 

I'm not interested at all in any organized religions. I've looked into Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and Wicca (mostly through friends) and though I can respect most religions and admire the way they bring comfort, they are not for me. I don't wish to be convinced of any particular doctrine of faith, nor do I think I could be at this point. 

**TL;DR Section** 

I don't actually want anyone to convince me of any specific afterlife.
I don't want anyone to convince me why having no afterlife is actually okay.

**I want someone to convince me that some form of afterlife might be possible. Convince me (if you can, scientifically) that there is at least a *chance*.**

Please CMV. It would bring me great comfort.

op_title: I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, CMV

You're asking for something impossible. Anything that can't be observed requires faith to believe in. Since we can't yet observe the afterlife (if such a thing exists,) we can't prove or disprove it. It's also possible that we're actually in the Matrix right now; all of us. Or that none of you exist, or that I don't exist; or that I'm a banana. None of those things are useful discussions because none of it can be proven or disproven. 

What you have to do is decide whether you're ok with a) dying and vanishing into nothing, or b) after you die the thoughts, feelings and experiences that made you you will go on. Personally, I don't think I would live very long if I believed I'll just vanish when I die. I'm of the opinion that there is an afterlife because it's what I have to do for survival. It's a paradox that I'm fully aware of and accept.

I don't know if my brutal honesty will help or hurt you in your quest for peace, but I do hope you hang in there. There's a lot of good you can do for the other bits of grey matter in this world.

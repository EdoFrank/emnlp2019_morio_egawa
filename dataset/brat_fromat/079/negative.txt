op_title: I don't believe in any kind of afterlife, CMV

I do personally believe in an afterlife, however, I cannot prove it so I am not going to try to argue it. But the reason why we are so driven to have sex is because our genes, our animal instinct wants to reproduce. It almost needs to. One may argue that the reason we have this desire to procreate is so that a piece of us does live on after we're gone. Our genes are still being passed on. A piece of my great great great great grandparents is still in me. My daughter looks almost exactly like me. Our things can easily be destroyed, but our genes are essentially immortal.

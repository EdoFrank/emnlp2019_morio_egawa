op_title: I believe Obama should be impeached and tried in civilian court for the unlawful killing of US Citizens in drone strikes. CMV.

As the title says, I think President Obama (and any others directly involved) should be impeached by Congress, subsequently removed from office, and tried in civilian court for (at the very least) murder for the killing of US citizens in overseas drone strikes. 

It has been well known for quite some time that the Obama administration has used drones overseas to kill certain targets, and that some of those killed were United States citizens. This is no longer something that people discuss and the government doesn't comment on; the administration has now admitted to the killing of four **US citizens** in drone strikes, three of whom were not targets.

My main argument stems from a reading of the Constitution. The Constitution represents a contract between the Government and The People. I find the following excerpts to be particularly important in this case (listed in order of applicability, with emphasis added):

~~Amendment XIV, Section 1, Paragraph 1:

&gt;**All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States** and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; **nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**~~

Amendment V:

&gt;**No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury**, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

Amendment VI:

&gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the **right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury** of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and **to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].**

Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 3:

&gt;The **Trial of all Crimes**, except in Cases of Impeachment, **shall be by Jury**; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

Article II, Section IV:

&gt;**The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of**, Treason, Bribery, or other **high Crimes and Misdemeanors.**

In my understanding of the Constitution, ~~all four~~ three of the fatalities were unlawful. ~~The killing of Anwar Al-Awlacki should be classified Murder in the First Degree, as it was clearly premeditated and he was not tried, so the killing cannot be deemed capital punishment.~~ The killing of Al-Awlacki can be justified by saying he was an enemy combatant, the capture of whom would have been infeasible. However, if the three were accidental as claimed, they are still felony manslaughter. Such felony level offenses are gross abuses of power, and must fit the definition of a "high crime". This, in my understanding, makes it obvious that impeachment is an appropriate course of action, and, if the Senate finds the defendants guilty, they should then be tried in civilian court, since the offenses are against other citizens of the United States.

Change my view.

**EDIT** /u/Jazz-Cigarettes changed my view on Al-Awlacki, but I remain unconvinced that the other three deaths are not impeachable offenses.

**EDIT 2** As /u/Tyrelxpeioust pointed out, the XIV Amendment applies only to the States (and so is irrelevant here), while the V Amendment is relevant.

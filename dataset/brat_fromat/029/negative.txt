op_title: I believe Obama should be impeached and tried in civilian court for the unlawful killing of US Citizens in drone strikes. CMV.

Other users have shown how his actions are probably legal, but from a moral standpoint, why is the fact that some of them were American even relevant? Is killing an American worse than killing a foreigner? With regard to Al-Awlacki, if you are involved in a terrorist group, why should the fact that you were born in the US protect you? I understand why people have a problem with drone strikes in general, but I do not understand why the fact that one of the targets was American matters for any reasons other than legal ones.

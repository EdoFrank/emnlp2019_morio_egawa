T1	Value 173 250	the drone strikes are problematic in a veritable cornucopia of different ways
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 256 283	here's my take on al-Awlaki
T3	Fact 287 341	He was both a U.S. citizen a senior member of al-Qaeda
T4	Value 350 414	it's fairly difficult to argue that he wasn't committing treason
T5	Value 426 560	in a perfect world, he'd deserve a trial for that treason, the result of which almost certainly would've been conviction and execution
T6	Value 567 729	he'd been out of the country and on the run for years, AND he was still actively participating in and abetting the operations of al-Qaeda right up until his death
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 734 814	what if a trial for al-Awlaki was never realistically going to be a possibility?
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 815 929	What if there was never going to be a feasible opportunity to capture him or conduct a raid on him a la bin Laden?
T9	Value 931 1053	It's not like he was a random high-value terrorist who regularly made visits to the U.S. where he could be easily captured
T10	Value 1055 1297	If he was revealed to be checking out a falafel restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Obama administration chose to drone strike him into oblivion when they could have easily apprehended him instead, that would be a regrettable decision
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1308 1530	al-Awlaki raises an interesting question: what do you do about an American citizen who is actively committing treason against the country, but is doing so while on the run and who may be difficult or impossible to capture?
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1531 1675	Do you allow him to continue coordinating terrorist attacks against you because you can't capture and try him, even though you *could* kill him?

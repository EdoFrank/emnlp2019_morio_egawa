op_title: I believe Obama should be impeached and tried in civilian court for the unlawful killing of US Citizens in drone strikes. CMV.

I think that in general, the drone strikes are problematic in a veritable cornucopia of different ways, but here's my take on al-Awlaki. 

He was both a U.S. citizen a senior member of al-Qaeda, and so it's fairly difficult to argue that he wasn't committing treason, right? So in a perfect world, he'd deserve a trial for that treason, the result of which almost certainly would've been conviction and execution.

But he'd been out of the country and on the run for years, AND he was still actively participating in and abetting the operations of al-Qaeda right up until his death. So what if a trial for al-Awlaki was never realistically going to be a possibility? What if there was never going to be a feasible opportunity to capture him or conduct a raid on him a la bin Laden?

It's not like he was a random high-value terrorist who regularly made visits to the U.S. where he could be easily captured. If he was revealed to be checking out a falafel restaurant in Nashville, Tennessee, and the Obama administration chose to drone strike him into oblivion when they could have easily apprehended him instead, that would be a regrettable decision.

I think al-Awlaki raises an interesting question: what do you do about an American citizen who is actively committing treason against the country, but is doing so while on the run and who may be difficult or impossible to capture? Do you allow him to continue coordinating terrorist attacks against you because you can't capture and try him, even though you *could* kill him?

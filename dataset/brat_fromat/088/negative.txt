How are they "a complete and utter scam"? Who are getting conned? The producers are offering a product that they make, for a price that they set. The consumer are usually well aware of the huge markup vs the difference in performance, and they are paying for the brand, which is their conscious decision. Those who buy these luxury cars are (usually) people who can afford that extra luxury of having either a social status symbol like the Bentley or the Maserati. They know exactly what they are doing when they are buying the car, and they are fully aware of the fact that they are paying for a brand name.

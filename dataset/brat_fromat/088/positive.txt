What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley.  I'm no expert, but my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made.  Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted.  And as a result of all this, not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher.  The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k.  I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less.

For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car.  

Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes.  If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment.

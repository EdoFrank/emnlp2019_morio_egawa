T1	Major_Claim 20 116	I feel that high-end luxury cars (Bentley, Rolls Royce, etc.) are a complete and utter scam. CMV
T2	Value 118 200	For about $50k, you can get a car with a fairly powerful motor and a nice interior
T3	Value 203 281	Getting up to the $100k range, you get a very strong motor and a nice interior
T4	Value 293 413	I'm unable to understand the appeal of paying $500k or more for a car that, most likely, performs the same as a $50k car
T5	Value 416 519	When I look at luxury cars, I see...tan/cream-colored leather interior, a powerful motor, and that's it
T6	Value 540 667	you're paying mostly for the little sticker that says the name of the car manufacturer instead of any actual benefit to the car
T7	Value 670 792	It could be the fact that I don't judge my worth by the things that I own, and I'm unable to understand the idea behind it
T8	Value 810 907	lower-end Cadillacs and Buicks probably perform the same function at roughly a tenth of the price

T1	Value 118 241	What you're saying is that there's basically no tangible difference between a $100,000 luxury car and a Rolls Royce/Bentley
T2	Testimony 244 257	I'm no expert
T3	Value 263 338	my understanding is that the difference is that they're basically hand made
T4	Value 341 429	Leather is hand stitched, they have a wood working shop, it's all carefully hand crafted
T5	Value 461 521	not many of these cars are made, which make the price higher
T6	Fact 524 643	The Rolls Royce Ghost is a 4-door sedan with hand-made interior that goes 0-60 in 4.7 seconds and it costs around $250k
T7	Value 646 741	I don't think it would be possible to easily produce and sell a car of similar quality for less
T8	Value 744 945	For people who have many millions (or billions) of dollars, the difference between a $100k and $250k for a luxury car isn't that big of a deal, and I think some rich people spend a lot of time in a car
T9	Value 950 1059	Sometimes they just like to own a unique item, but also a status symbol can be worth a lot of money sometimes
T10	Value 1062 1140	If the car helps you to secure a billion dollar deal, it was a good investment

For about $50k, you can get a car with a fairly powerful motor and a nice interior.  Getting up to the $100k range, you get a very strong motor and a nice interior.  However, I'm unable to understand the appeal of paying $500k or more for a car that, most likely, performs the same as a $50k car.  When I look at luxury cars, I see...tan/cream-colored leather interior, a powerful motor, and that's it.  I'm guessing that you're paying mostly for the little sticker that says the name of the car manufacturer instead of any actual benefit to the car.  It could be the fact that I don't judge my worth by the things that I own, and I'm unable to understand the idea behind it.  I imagine that lower-end Cadillacs and Buicks probably perform the same function at roughly a tenth of the price.

Many men told stories of being raped by women here:

There are statistics on this. According to the latest CDC (US government) survey, 4.8% of all men have been "made to penetrate" and 79.2% of the perpetrators were women. Examples of "made to penetrate" are: a woman who has sex with a man who is passed-out drunk, or a woman who forces a man to have sex with her through violence or threats of violence. There is some confusion due to the fact that their definition of rape excluded "made to penetrate" and only included men who had been penetrated. That was far less common (1.4% of men) and was mostly perpetrated by men. However, if you include "made to penetrate" as rape, which you should, since it is forced sex, women are a significant percentage of rapists, and the majority of male rape victims were raped by women. You can read the report at: 
http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf Here are direct quotes from the report:

"Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime"

"For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%)."

The above, lifetime stats do show a lower percentage of male victims (up to 6.2% of all men) than female victims (18.3% of all women) although this is far more than commonly believed. However, if you look at the report's stats for the past 12 months, just as many number of men have been "forced to penetrate" as women were raped, meaning that if you properly include being "made to penetrate" in the definition of rape, men were raped as often as women. 

Here are additional studies that show a significant number of female rapists: 

1) This academic study of university students shows similar rates of victimization between men and women: http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/ID45-PR45.pdf
Page 412 discusses the results for men and page 414 discusses the results for women. There's a nice table here that presents the results of this study in a clearer way: http://feck-blog.blogspot.com/2011/05/predictors-of-sexual-coercion-against.html

2) Here's another study regarding sexual coercion of university students: http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-20318535/sexual-coercion-men-victimized-by-women

3) Here's another study: http://www.ejhs.org/volume5/deviancetonormal.htm
The conclusion states, "the evidence presented here shows that as many as 7% of women self-report the use of physical force to obtain sex, 40% self-report sexual coercion, and over 50% self-report initiating sexual contact with a man while his judgment was impaired by drugs or alcohol".

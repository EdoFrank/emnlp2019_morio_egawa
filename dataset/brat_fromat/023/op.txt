op_title: I believe a woman cannot rape a man. CMV!

Edit: Since I didn't follow the rules very well, let me expand upon what I mean.

Sure, a woman can perhaps "rape" a man with a broom stick or something. I'm not saying that can't happen. And I certainly think a man can rape a man. I'm talking about penetrative vaginal intercourse. I don't believe a woman can rape a man in that way. 

**Last Edit: So it looks like this subreddit is pretty much a joke. Out of all the replies I got, only three even attempted to change my mind, and only one that I can recall was not openly hostile. It's really pathetic, considering what this subreddit is supposed to be. The vast majority of the comments were basically flaming and personal attacks, and ANY comment I made to clarify or defend my opinion was just downvoted into oblivion. It's kind of sad and pathetic that on a "CHANGE MY VIEW" subreddit, the userbase seems to be completely incapable of respectfully arguing with logic and evidence, and just succumbs to personal attacks. I shan't return here.**

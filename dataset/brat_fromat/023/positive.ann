T1	Fact 63 113	Many men told stories of being raped by women here
T2	Fact 217 245	There are statistics on this
T3	Fact 247 385	According to the latest CDC (US government) survey, 4.8% of all men have been "made to penetrate" and 79.2% of the perpetrators were women
T4	Fact 387 568	Examples of "made to penetrate" are: a woman who has sex with a man who is passed-out drunk, or a woman who forces a man to have sex with her through violence or threats of violence
T5	Value 570 714	There is some confusion due to the fact that their definition of rape excluded "made to penetrate" and only included men who had been penetrated
T6	Value 716 788	That was far less common (1.4% of men) and was mostly perpetrated by men
T7	Value 799 989	if you include "made to penetrate" as rape, which you should, since it is forced sex, women are a significant percentage of rapists, and the majority of male rape victims were raped by women
T8	Fact 1127 1236	Approximately 1 in 21 men (4.8%) reported that they were made to penetrate someone else during their lifetime
T9	Fact 1240 1444	For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%)
T10	Fact 1459 1581	lifetime stats do show a lower percentage of male victims (up to 6.2% of all men) than female victims (18.3% of all women)
T11	Value 1591 1630	this is far more than commonly believed
T12	Value 1641 1901	if you look at the report's stats for the past 12 months, just as many number of men have been "forced to penetrate" as women were raped, meaning that if you properly include being "made to penetrate" in the definition of rape, men were raped as often as women
T13	Value 1905 1981	Here are additional studies that show a significant number of female rapists
T14	Fact 1988 2089	This academic study of university students shows similar rates of victimization between men and women
T15	Fact 2135 2218	Page 412 discusses the results for men and page 414 discusses the results for women
T16	Value 2220 2302	There's a nice table here that presents the results of this study in a clearer way
T17	Fact 2389 2458	Here's another study regarding sexual coercion of university students
T18	Fact 2548 2568	Here's another study
T19	Fact 2643 2904	the evidence presented here shows that as many as 7% of women self-report the use of physical force to obtain sex, 40% self-report sexual coercion, and over 50% self-report initiating sexual contact with a man while his judgment was impaired by drugs or alcohol

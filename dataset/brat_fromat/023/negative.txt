Here's wikipedia's definition of rape: 

&gt;Rape is a type of sexual assault usually involving sexual intercourse, which is initiated by one or more persons against another person without that person's consent. 

&gt;The act may be carried out by physical force, coercion, abuse of authority or with a person who is incapable of valid consent, such as one who is unconscious, incapacitated, or below the legal age of consent

So, for instance, if a woman broke into a man's house with a gun, held it on him and made him have sex with her while under the threat of being shot, that would be coercing him into sex with her, which would be rape.

Erections are also involuntary. For instance, a person who is unconscious can still get hard. Men who have broken their backs and cannot move their lower bodies are still capable of sexual stimulation and having sex. A woman who drugs a man and then has sex with him while he's passed out is raping him, and is having non-consensual vaginal sex.

Those are two examples. 

There's also the example of [A russian hairdresser who knocked out, tied up, force fed viagra to, and repeatedly raped a man who broke into her store.](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2013870/Robber-broke-hair-salon-beaten-black-belt-owner-kept-sex-slave-days--fed-Viagra.html)

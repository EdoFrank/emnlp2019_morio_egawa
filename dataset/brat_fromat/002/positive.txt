op_title: While I agree with vegetarianism, I still eat meat because I don't think it will make a difference to the meat industry whether or not one person eats meat. CMV

As one in a similar situation morally I feel similarly, though my concerns are purely hedonistic! I love me some bacon. For your economic concerns i can try to change your view!

Essentially when you go to a restaurant and order a salad, the restaurant may not notice, but you have made a decision eith your money. If you do that more (or more people do it) the average amount of meat the restaurant buys will drop (probably minutely, but over time the price of meat will go up because demand is going down).

The same goes for the supermarket. If you buy meat, then the supermarket will continue to buy meet in the same quantity. If you do not, then while the effect might be small, it's small in the right direction and will push the quantity of meat demanded down!

So while your individual impact is small, it can be small in the right direction or the wrong direction.
I've decided to simply do the better thing, not the best thing, and eat less meat :p i just have such a strong taste for it that until eating vegetarian is a more affordable and *easy* solution, I wont be giving it up altogether!

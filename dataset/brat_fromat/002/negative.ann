T1	Value 181 205	Your reasoning is faulty
T2	Value 214 346	the food industry is just as profit driven as any other industry that means that they will produce whatever we as consumers will buy
T3	Value 348 547	If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production
T4	Value 564 812	the restaurant you go to won't stop buying meat because your friend ordered a sallad it will change it's menu if they see a change in what people order and if enough restaurants change their menus then the food industry will change their production
T5	Value 814 910	No one person can change the world all we can do is change ourselves and hope that others follow
T6	Testimony 914 1174	Where I come from things are already changing we have more vegitarian restaurants now than we had 10 years ago, we have an active debate about meat consumption, schools introduced vegitarian options and now some public schools are introducing meat free mondays
T7	Rhetorical_Statement 1203 1250	If you refuse to change why should anyone else?
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 1307 1358	You must be the change you want to see in the world

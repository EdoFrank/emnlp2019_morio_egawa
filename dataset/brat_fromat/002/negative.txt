Your reasoning is faulty because the food industry is just as profit driven as any other industry that means that they will produce whatever we as consumers will buy. If we eat less meat and more vegitarian then eventually the demand for vegitarian alternatives will cause the food industry to focus more on vegitarian food and less on industrialised meat production. And eventhough the restaurant you go to won't stop buying meat because your friend ordered a sallad it will change it's menu if they see a change in what people order and if enough restaurants change their menus then the food industry will change their production. No one person can change the world all we can do is change ourselves and hope that others follow. 

Where I come from things are already changing we have more vegitarian restaurants now than we had 10 years ago, we have an active debate about meat consumption, schools introduced vegitarian options and now some public schools are introducing meat free mondays.

I try to think like this: If you refuse to change why should anyone else?

Or as someone more eloquent than me once put it:

&gt;"You must be the change you want to see in the world"

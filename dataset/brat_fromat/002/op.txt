op_title: While I agree with vegetarianism, I still eat meat because I don't think it will make a difference to the meat industry whether or not one person eats meat. CMV

I think the way animals are treated here is absolutely detestable. I think as humans who have access to a vegetarian or vegan diet, we have a responsibility to not slaughter animals for meat. It's just that, I don't feel like whether or not I eat meat matters to companies that slaughter animals. 

My problem isn't with eating meat, it's with funding slaughterhouses. For instance, when I'm at a restaurant that serves meat with a vegetarian friend, they order a salad. The money they spent still goes to a company that funds slaughterhouses, right? They don't separate vegan and carnivore money. Unless you exclusively shop at vegetarian/vegan stores for food or grow your own food, you're giving money to a company that pays slaughterhouses to kill animals. Why should I be a vegetarian then? (Please please please convince me I'm wrong)

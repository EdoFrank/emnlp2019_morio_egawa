op_title: Unless an animal clearly doesn't enjoy what's happening, I believe bestiality should not be morally frowned upon. I've searched and found no good arguments, so CMV (read the first sentence before you downvote)

It seems like you want a moral argument:

Your definition of consent that you outlined is the absence of refusal, but that's not what consent is. There are various cases, for example, in which boyfriends have coerced their girlfriends into having sex, so that the girls don't give permission but don't or can't necessarily outright refuse, even if they would not like to have sex. Most people would consider this as a form of rape. This problem is exacerbated when it comes to animals. There is not really any way to clearly communicate between animals and humans to do any consenting. Sure, maybe you can try to "assume" the animal is consenting because it isn't resisting, but some animals just stay really still out of fear. Even if there's no readily apparent physical harm, there can be psychological harm, which is much harder to gauge. I've seen dogs that are very submissive because they've gone through abuse, but it's often hard to differentiate between those who are naturally submissive or forced into submission, especially when it happened at a very early age. I suppose you could argue that the animals themselves might be the ones initiating the sex, but also remember that there is a huge power imbalance. Animals are not humans, even if they may have some human characteristics, and they do not think or respond as we would. We are *much* smarter than animals, even more so than children. We can sometimes literally condition them into what we want them to be (a more extreme version of teachers or relatives "conditioning" children to love them in a sexual way). So unless there comes a different species that is equally as smart as us and makes similar thought and behavior processes as us, sex with animals will never be moral.

T1	Major_Claim 20 229	Unless an animal clearly doesn't enjoy what's happening, I believe bestiality should not be morally frowned upon. I've searched and found no good arguments, so CMV (read the first sentence before you downvote)
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 742 769	The issue of **"consent."**
T3	Value 789 924	animals are in a position to be able to respond back and clearly show whether they're uncomfortable when you're doing something, or not
T4	Value 927 1101	Animals are not bound by law (consciously anyways) to refrain from attacking you, getting frustrated, annoyed, or anything, if you were to take them out of their comfort zone
T5	Policy 1116 1368	unless an animal's behavior implies "no," that it should be acceptable, and if somebody continues to have sex with an animal who implies "no," it will be obvious from signs of trauma stemming from the animal, and should be classified under animal abuse
T6	Testimony 1371 1511	There's also an argument I heard, **"They don't have a conscious grasp of sex, so that means they can not consent, meaning it's not okay!"**
T7	Value 1537 1651	as long as it is not harming the animal, whether an animal knows what you're doing or not is completely irrelevant
T8	Value 1654 1738	I personally do not practice bestiality, nor do I want to, nor have I ever wanted to
T9	Value 1751 1788	it just doesn't seem like a bad thing
T10	Value 1803 1834	bestiality is only frowned upon
T11	Value 1843 1889	society hates taboos, ESPECIALLY sexual taboos

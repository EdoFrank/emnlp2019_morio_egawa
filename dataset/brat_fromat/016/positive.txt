op_title: Unless an animal clearly doesn't enjoy what's happening, I believe bestiality should not be morally frowned upon. I've searched and found no good arguments, so CMV (read the first sentence before you downvote)

If I were to guess (and sorry, but I don't feel like researching this from work), I would say that the relevant argument probably deals with two issues:

1. Is it possible for an animal to become traumatized in ways that are not readily apparent during the act itself? If trauma can manifest *after* the fact, then there might be no reasonable way of protecting the animal except to ban bestiality in its entirety.

2. Assuming the potential harm *is* apparent beforehand, the question becomes whether we trust the person seeking the activity to be the one to judge. If you're looking to get your jollies with your poodle Fifi, are you going to notice a subtle "no" clue from a small animal that could never physically resist (or is too scared to)?

These two issues are a lot of why statutory rape laws exist - not because we think that all 16 year olds are incapable of a mature sexual relationship, but because a lot of them are and it's not always easy to tell beforehand which are and which aren't. To make it worse, we don't trust the ones encouraging the relationship to make a sound judgment on that issue.

T1	Fact 105 167	they did exactly this in the U.K. about thirty or so years ago
T2	Value 170 228	It all seems logical and practical and like it should work
T3	Fact 237 321	they decided that legally, ownership was satisfied if you could own something at all
T4	Fact 327 415	handguns were turned in in huge numbers and you were allowed to keep rifles and shotguns
T5	Fact 423 443	it was shotguns only
T6	Fact 451 534	you could only keep them if you had a proven use for them like on a farm or similar
T7	Value 537 671	Thirty years later and the inventers of most of our modern arms and the people who helped us the most in WWII are completely castrated
T8	Value 674 731	Firearms are essentially gone and crime is out of control
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 737 770	what was the critical difference?
T10	Value 792 875	it's that your argument pre-supposes that firearms are a priviledge and not a right
T11	Value 878 970	You go into the creation of the list with a view that logically will lead you down this path
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 977 1011	let's get into each statement/idea
T13	Value 1022 1053	some are good, and some are not
T14	Value 1150 1167	This sounds great
T15	Fact 1174 1230	this is alrady what happens with concealed carry permits
T16	Policy 1233 1413	A smarter approach would be to make a nationwide standard and database for CCW permits (it's a hodge-podge of conflicting laws currently and some states accept others, some do not)
T17	Policy 1422 1596	make a concerted effort to promote such permit ownership to our youths (say, training leading up to a full permit at adulthood) and as part of self-defense programs and so on
T18	Policy 1599 1659	We need more firearms in the hands of good, trained citizens
T19	Rhetorical_Statement 1668 1678	Absolutely
T20	Fact 1681 1732	We do this in California already to buy any firearm
T21	Value 1739 1796	the issue again is every state has its own rules and laws
T22	Policy 1799 1861	There needs to be one database and one standard for all states
T23	Testimony 1871 1907	I'm a big proponent of States rights
T24	Value 1913 2034	in many ways, the patchwork of laws creates more headache that it's worth when we're trying to tackle a natiowide problem
T25	Value 2056 2085	this is completely unworkable
T26	Value 2099 2212	you can reload your own ammo for pennies a round, and hundreds of millions of rounds are already in private hands
T27	Value 2214 2240	it's never going to happen
T28	Rhetorical_Statement 2248 2255	Correct
T29	Value 2258 2334	People will just load their own or drive across town to where it's not taxed
T30	Policy 2356 2402	it would have to be one law for the entire U.S
T31	Value 2414 2525	there's issues with unfair taxes vs states rights and that would simply take decades to deal with in the courts
T32	Value 2528 2637	Federal regulations are one thing, but adding an "ammo tax" which it would be called, is a political quagmire
T33	Fact 2644 2679	We already do this with CCW permits
T34	Value 2682 2914	The issue is that we have so many areas where you can't carry it or you can't carry it in across state lines (permit not seen as valid) that too many people leave them at home or in their cars or someplace other than on their person
T35	Policy 2916 2969	This also needs to be cleaned up at the Federal level
T36	Value 2972 3086	A higher level permit as you suggest would possibly let you carry in such paces, like bounty hunters and guards do
T37	Policy 3088 3172	Promote this as possibly some sort of deputy corps to help out the overworked police
T38	Value 3179 3214	They already do this in most states
T39	Value 3217 3269	The issue is... wait for it... the states that don't
T40	Rhetorical_Statement 3276 3294	Unworkable, really
T41	Value 3303 3348	This is almost the law in some states already
T42	Value 3351 3381	I see no issue with it, really
T43	Value 3384 3452	As a firearm owner, your responsibility to secure it is exactly that
T44	Value 3455 3484	Fines should seem appropriate
T45	Value 3503 3570	if they steal your entire safe, it shouldn't be entirely your fault
T46	Value 3585 3599	this is a must
T47	Value 3602 3669	A good example of this sort of problem in the past was civil rights
T48	Value 3672 3836	When you left it up to every city and state to have different laws about voting rights, laws, police enforcement, and so on, it was a social and emotional nightmare
T49	Value 3839 3938	Only when you made it one law for everyone did we get compliance and the start of a workable system

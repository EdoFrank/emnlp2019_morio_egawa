T1	Value 83 275	I don't see any reason not to institute mandatory background checks (which red flags from the background check would make you ineligible is another issue) or institute some sort of gun license
T2	Value 287 393	the fee is not exorbitant and the process for applying for the license is not too difficult or restrictive
T3	Value 406 634	the mental health evaluation you suggest sounds like it would have more room for abuse and would have a tendency to be expensive for the potential gun owner (if you're thinking about an appointment with a certified psychologist)
T4	Value 637 744	Paperwork demonstrating transfer of ownership, similar to what we do for cars, also sounds like a good idea
T5	Value 747 952	I don't think a gun owner should be held accountable if one of their guns is stolen and used in a crime any more than a car owner would be held accountable if their car were stolen and then used in a crime
T6	Value 977 1197	if you fail to properly transfer ownership of a gun and that gun is used in a crime, there should probably be some consequences for you, though obviously not as severe as for the person who actually perpetrated the crime
T7	Value 1200 1353	I don't think that owners of "semiautomatic handguns, assault weapons or large magazines" should be subject to "frequent and intrusive recertifications."
T8	Policy 1354 1447	The license/background check, if we instituted one, should be the same as for a hunting rifle
T9	Value 1449 1645	I could be convinced otherwise if research showed that semiautomatic handguns, etc. were more likely to be involved in a violent crimes, accidents, and/or suicides than hunting rifles and shotguns
T10	Value 1669 1719	such data does not exist for the US--in large part
T11	Value 1728 1854	the NRA keeps shooting itself in the foot (ha!) by blocking the funding of organizations that want to do this kind of research
T12	Testimony 1875 2065	a post recently with data from another country (Australia maybe?) showing that deaths caused by assault weapons, etc. were negligible compared to deaths caused by hunting rifles and shotguns
T13	Testimony 2069 2251	The only gun I own is a semi-automatic .22 caliber handgun with a 10-shot magazine that I won in a raffle when I was 16 (I didn't technically own it until I turned 21--my father did)
T14	Testimony 2253 2289	I enjoy shooting targets with my dad
T15	Testimony 2295 2334	it's not my favorite thing in the world
T16	Value 2336 2416	I do not believe that my .22 "semi-automatic" weapon makes me a dangerous person
T17	Value 2418 2567	I also do not believe it will help me stand up against a totalitarian government (nor do I fear the US turning into such a government in my lifetime)
T18	Value 2578 2754	I would like to keep it and would rather not pay several hundred dollars for a license or undergo rigorous psychiatric examination in order to maintain ownership of my property
T19	Value 2756 3024	If reliable research showed that my type of gun was 10 times more likely to be involved in a violent crime than a hunting rifle, then I would reluctantly deal with the new regulations or (more likely) sell my gun to someone who was willing to deal with the regulations
T20	Value 3026 3057	I wouldn't raise much of a fuss
T21	Value 3066 3110	I like reading and Reddit more than shooting
T22	Value 3116 3404	my father would be very upset since his primary hobbies do involve guns, and it would make me sad to see him go through the type of bureaucracy that you propose, especially without a reasonable demonstration beforehand that the changes would actually result in a reduction of gun violence
T23	Value 3422 3496	the NRA is more to blame for the lack of research we have than anyone else
T24	Policy 3498 3650	Stop the NRA from continuing their shenanigans, present me with some cold, hard facts or reasonable projections, and my views could change significantly

op_title: I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please

I believe that art requires skill, talent, insight and hard work -- that properly executed, art touches the soul of the viewer. I've taken a few art history courses, and to my eye, western art peaked with the [Post-Impressionists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionism). It's been downhill since then. There is an ineffable something in the [sunflowers of Van Gogh](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Four_Cut_Sunflowers.jpg), or a [Cezanne](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/impressionism/cezanne-card-players.jpg) or [Monet](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/waterlilies/monet.wl-clouds.jpg), that is not there in modern and post modern art.

I don't get anything from pieces like [this Jackson Pollock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:No._5,_1948.jpg) or [this Rothko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rothko_No_14.jpg) for example. They neither excite nor inspire me, and definitely do not touch my soul. Reading about these artists, it appears that they, at one time, did something innovative that caught the eye of the art world. Instead of becoming fleetingly notorious, they became famous, and this fame fed on itself, making them 'masters' in the eyes of the art world. Articles like [this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/nyregion/one-queens-painter-created-forgeries-that-sold-for-millions-us-says.html), where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view.
   
Not all art since 1950 is bad of course, I felt an instant connection the first time I saw the work of [Kieron Williamson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Williamson) (for instance, [this landscape](http://www.kieronwilliamson.com/Portals/11/Favourite%20View.JPG)), but most contemporary work seems to me dull and insipid. I'll be happy if anyone can change my view. 

N.B. By art I mean paintings, sculptures and installations. Other forms of art, writing, drama and music especially, are still interesting and healthy. 

Edit: added links to examples.

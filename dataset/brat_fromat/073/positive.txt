op_title: I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please

I work in an art gallery. You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre-1950s that manages to survive. There were big trends of "artists" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top, because it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent. Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand. There will always be amateurs, con artists, and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era.  
  
Also, you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art. There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today, but as with all kinds of creations, most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like. I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites. For now, pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now. Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website: [David Mach's coat hanger sculpture] (http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/david-machs-coat-hanger-sculptures), [Chiharu Shiota's installations](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/installations-by-chiharu-shiota), and [Stephanie Clark's embrodiery](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/embroidered-architecture-by-stephanie-kelly).  
  
It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online (eg video, the texture of string, illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room). If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries, you're missing a lot of great stuff.

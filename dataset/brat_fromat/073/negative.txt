op_title: I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please

There's a pretty big leap between saying that you don't "get" modern art, and denying altogether that its even art. 

&gt;Articles like this one[7] , where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view.

That "forger" was also trained at an art school. That person is a fraud for passing off his own paintings as those of more famous artists, but to do so required skill, talent, insight, and hard work.

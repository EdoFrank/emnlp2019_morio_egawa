T1	Major_Claim 20 138	I believe that mainstream contemporary art since the 1950s is juvenile and shallow; in short it is not art. CMV please
T2	Value 155 266	art requires skill, talent, insight and hard work -- that properly executed, art touches the soul of the viewer
T3	Value 268 419	I've taken a few art history courses, and to my eye, western art peaked with the [Post-Impressionists](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Impressionism)
T4	Value 421 450	It's been downhill since then
T5	Value 452 825	There is an ineffable something in the [sunflowers of Van Gogh](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Four_Cut_Sunflowers.jpg), or a [Cezanne](http://www.theartwolf.com/articles/impressionism/cezanne-card-players.jpg) or [Monet](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/monet/waterlilies/monet.wl-clouds.jpg), that is not there in modern and post modern art
T6	Value 828 1020	I don't get anything from pieces like [this Jackson Pollock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:No._5,_1948.jpg) or [this Rothko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rothko_No_14.jpg) for example
T7	Value 1022 1093	They neither excite nor inspire me, and definitely do not touch my soul
T8	Value 1095 1220	Reading about these artists, it appears that they, at one time, did something innovative that caught the eye of the art world
T9	Value 1222 1363	Instead of becoming fleetingly notorious, they became famous, and this fame fed on itself, making them 'masters' in the eyes of the art world
T10	Value 1365 1668	Articles like [this one](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/nyregion/one-queens-painter-created-forgeries-that-sold-for-millions-us-says.html), where a forger created dozens of works supposedly by various modern artists, and managed to fool critics, art historians and collectors, just reinforces my view
T11	Value 1674 1703	Not all art since 1950 is bad
T12	Testimony 1715 1942	I felt an instant connection the first time I saw the work of [Kieron Williamson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Williamson) (for instance, [this landscape](http://www.kieronwilliamson.com/Portals/11/Favourite%20View.JPG))
T13	Value 1948 1999	most contemporary work seems to me dull and insipid
T14	Value 2052 2105	By art I mean paintings, sculptures and installations
T15	Value 2107 2197	Other forms of art, writing, drama and music especially, are still interesting and healthy

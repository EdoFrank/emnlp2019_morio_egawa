T1	Testimony 140 164	I work in an art gallery
T2	Rhetorical_Statement 166 241	You'd be amazed at how much crap there is pre-1950s that manages to survive
T3	Value 243 353	There were big trends of "artists" who pre-painted torsos and then hastily painted their client's heads on top
T4	Value 363 447	it was a quick way for the average joe to make some decent money without much talent
T5	Value 449 511	Half of these guys didn't even bother painting a coherent hand
T6	Value 513 643	There will always be amateurs, con artists, and plain art you don't like screwing up what you would otherwise consider a great era
T7	Value 656 766	you seem to have an issue with 1970s abstract expressionism and are using it to represent all contemporary art
T8	Value 768 817	There is a lot of fantastic stuff out there today
T9	Value 823 902	as with all kinds of creations, most of it will be crap or stuff you don't like
T10	Rhetorical_Statement 904 1023	I wish I was on my home computer so I could browse my collection of contemporary art and show you some of my favourites
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 1034 1137	pick up an issue of Juxtapoz or Spectrum 21 to see the kind of cool things that are happening right now
T12	Rhetorical_Statement 1139 1521	Some I picked up just from a quick browse of Juxtapoz's website: [David Mach's coat hanger sculpture] (http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/david-machs-coat-hanger-sculptures), [Chiharu Shiota's installations](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/installations-by-chiharu-shiota), and [Stephanie Clark's embrodiery](http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/embroidered-architecture-by-stephanie-kelly)
T13	Value 1528 1786	It's worth pointing out a lot of contemporary artists are now doing things on larger scales or with materials that cannot be properly represented online (eg video, the texture of string, illusions that can only be felt from a certain perspective in the room)
T14	Value 1788 1874	If you're not regularly setting foot in galleries, you're missing a lot of great stuff

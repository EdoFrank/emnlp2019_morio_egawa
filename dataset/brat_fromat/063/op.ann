T1	Major_Claim 20 130	I think the academic elitist views of engineering and other STEM fields in undergrad are justified. Please CMV
T2	Value 582 694	the academic elitist view of many engineers (myself included) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes
T3	Testimony 696 751	I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors
T4	Value 764 816	at this point it's a justified view for them as well
T5	Value 859 1141	After having taken a number of upper-level social science courses as required non-tech electives (some economics, psychology, philosophy), it is my opinion that non-STEM majors (excluding skill-based arts/music) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade
T6	Value 1143 1320	If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead
T7	Value 1322 1404	I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering
T8	Value 1406 1466	They may be able to make it through the introductory courses
T9	Value 1471 1653	upper level undergraduate sequences of classes like heat and mass balances --&gt; fluid transport --&gt; heat and mass transfer I think would prove nearly impossible for the majority
T10	Value 1672 1727	I am better than my fellow non-STEM majors academically
T11	Value 1746 1846	I can do everything they can do in addition to being able to do something that they are unable to do
T12	Value 1857 1898	this is a *very negative* view to possess
T13	Value 1907 1942	I devalue the effort other students
T14	Value 2118 2241	I do not believe that I am more intelligent or that STEM majors are inherently more intelligent that people in other fields
T15	Value 2243 2492	Many of you have made my conscious of the fact that what I believe stems more from the fact that the mid-level university I attend does not seem to have as strict of requirements for non-STEM majors in regard to coursework as it does for STEM majors
T16	Value 2506 2606	there are programs out there with excellent non-STEM programs that I would be in way over my head at

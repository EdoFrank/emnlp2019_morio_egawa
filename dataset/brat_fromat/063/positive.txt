op_title: I think the academic elitist views of engineering and other STEM fields in undergrad are justified. Please CMV

Did it occur to you that you were taking introductory classes?  Even if they weren't at the introductory level, some humanities classes are made for students in other programs to take as electives. If you had aced something like critical perspectives or Middle English I'd be more impressed. 

Also, not all STEM students pick it up as well as you did. I've seen plenty of engineers get their asses handed to the by an English course.  I took an elective commerce class where we had to do a group project. My group was mostly engineers and biology majors.  Before we handed it in I had to hastily rewrite the whole thing because so much of what the others wrote wasn't even readable.

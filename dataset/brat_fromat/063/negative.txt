op_title: I think the academic elitist views of engineering and other STEM fields in undergrad are justified. Please CMV

I'd like to point out to all the people here claiming to have gotten an A in calculus despite being a humanities major: chances are that you didn't take the real calculus course. You probably took the elective course offered to students outside engineering, math, physics majors. A good way to determine whether or not this is the case is if you got a reasonable grade before the curve.

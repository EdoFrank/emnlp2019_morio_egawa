op_title: [CMV] I believe the reality around me does not exist, and there is no way to prove it does

I'm convinced that it's not possible to rely on the world around me to be real and that there is no way to prove it to me. An extension of that is that I feel like there is no way to actually know anything whatsoever.

From math to physics and chemistry, every science has holes in it and they depend on big assumptions about reality that cannot ever doubted, otherwise the whole system falls over. 

For example, mathematics, being one of the most fundamental basis of our perception of the world, depends on axioms and postulates that boil down to "Been tested a ton of times, makes sense in our heads" for even the simplest statements of x=x. Or that 1+1 = 2 because we've never encountered a situation where this was not true.

Anything as fundamental as that, and just the whole knowledge of human biology where the brain depends on outside input to judge its environment and "prove" reality to itself seems utterly flawed. Think about it. I don't know if what I see in front of me is actually there. I don't know if the people I talk to are real. How can they even prove it to me?

Furthering that, some movies even expressly touch these tenets like The Matrix, Total Recall, and even Inception. 

I am utterly, without a doubt, convinced of this, live my life according to this belief.

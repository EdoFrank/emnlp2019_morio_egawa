You say that there is no way to know anything. But how can you know that, really? Couldn't you stumble across a way to know things some day? You can say that you know nothing at the moment, but to say that you never knew anything, or that you will never know anything, seems awfully overconfident.

So, if there is no need for the situation to remain as it is, then searching for a way to change the situation may be valid. Also, we regularly make actions based on knowledge and logic (I need to eat, you need to eat), so even if you don't believe in logic, you had better act as if you do.

A minor quibble:

The logic of an argument is independent of the people speaking it. If an argument just popped out of the ether, that wouldn't make it any less valid than if it came out of a person.

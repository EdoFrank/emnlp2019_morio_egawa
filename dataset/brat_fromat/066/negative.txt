How exactly do you live your life according to that belief? 

Remember that one of the core aspects of science is that it never considers itself to be definitively correct about something. It only tries to provide evidence as to what is most probable to be correct at the moment.

The scientific foundation was laid by people who had the same thoughts as you. They just decided to live with it and try to find out as much as possible, in the hope that some day, we would all know more about what we are and why. Perhaps you should join that adventure? :)

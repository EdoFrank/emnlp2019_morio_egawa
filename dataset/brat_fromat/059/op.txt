op_title: I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV.

I was just watching some self-defense videos on YouTube which showed some standard techniques.  
For example, [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJz8YQ5rXZw) is one such video that explains how to escape the mount.  

When I see these videos, I just can't help but feel that everything they show is rehearsed and that it wouldn't work in a real life situation.  
[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CusoFfBmTWU) another video I saw. In the video, the "victim" is on the ground and the "attacker" is standing. The instructor explains what a person should do in such a situation: keep your knees up, track the attacker, and kick. But if you notice, at 1:42, when the attacker goes around, it's just so rehearsed and slow! In a real situation, someone on the ground would not be able to turn as fast as a person can run on their feet. And once the attacker is close to the victim's head, he can kick/stomp.  
Also, the video *assumes* that the attacker will want to get close to the victim's head, but that might not always be the case. The attacker could just stay in one place and kick the victim back. And if the attacker is standing, his kicks will have a lot more power than the victim's, who is on the ground.

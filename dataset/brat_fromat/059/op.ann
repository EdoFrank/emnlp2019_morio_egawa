T1	Major_Claim 20 126	I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV.
T2	Testimony 128 221	I was just watching some self-defense videos on YouTube which showed some standard techniques
T3	Fact 238 344	[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJz8YQ5rXZw) is one such video that explains how to escape the mount
T4	Value 349 490	When I see these videos, I just can't help but feel that everything they show is rehearsed and that it wouldn't work in a real life situation
T5	Testimony 494 566	[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CusoFfBmTWU) another video I saw
T6	Fact 568 642	In the video, the "victim" is on the ground and the "attacker" is standing
T7	Fact 644 761	The instructor explains what a person should do in such a situation: keep your knees up, track the attacker, and kick
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 767 854	if you notice, at 1:42, when the attacker goes around, it's just so rehearsed and slow!
T9	Value 855 965	In a real situation, someone on the ground would not be able to turn as fast as a person can run on their feet
T10	Value 971 1037	once the attacker is close to the victim's head, he can kick/stomp
T11	Value 1047 1128	the video *assumes* that the attacker will want to get close to the victim's head
T12	Value 1134 1167	that might not always be the case
T13	Value 1169 1235	The attacker could just stay in one place and kick the victim back
T14	Value 1241 1346	if the attacker is standing, his kicks will have a lot more power than the victim's, who is on the ground

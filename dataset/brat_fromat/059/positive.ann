T1	Rhetorical_Statement 128 147	Karate student here
T2	Value 149 211	We have a few types of learning, and we learn the canned moves
T3	Value 213 297	We learn how to perfectly execute a shuto sakotsu uchi, a downward knife hand strike
T4	Value 299 356	We learn how to do a perfectly formed inside middle block
T5	Value 358 479	We even hold separate courses on "street self-defense", teaching how to get out of holds and what to do in what situation
T6	Value 491 547	when it comes to Kumite, fighting, all of that goes away
T7	Value 549 621	No one pays attention to proper form, they just block, strike, and dodge
T8	Rhetorical_Statement 627 686	does this mean that all the technical learning didn't help?
T9	Rhetorical_Statement 687 701	Not even close
T10	Testimony 703 816	I can't touch the black belts in Kumite, even the ones that are 5 years younger than me and have far shorter arms
T11	Value 818 877	No one is expected to perfectly execute what they're taught
T12	Value 883 1089	in being taught the canned moves, they learn what the moves should look like, how they work, and what they're supposed to do, and in that they can use them more effectively, in their own way, in real combat
T13	Value 1097 1198	I may not bring my hand all the way up and strike exactly at the collarbone with a shuto sakotsu uchi
T14	Value 1200 1409	I'll certainly instinctively form my hand into the right position, bring my hand as high as time constraints allow me to do, and then strike more effectively at the area I know my strike will be most effective
T15	Value 1411 1539	None of that will be exactly proper form, just as you'll most likely never use the exact same moves that you see in those videos
T16	Value 1545 1652	the things you do learn do allow you to know the general move, and utilize it for your purpose when you can
T17	Value 1655 1764	Watching a couple videos will obviously not be enough to give you an adequate measure of self-defense ability
T18	Value 1770 1860	canned techniques, when adequately practiced, can definitely help in a real life situation

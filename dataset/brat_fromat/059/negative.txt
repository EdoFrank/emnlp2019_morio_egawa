op_title: I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV.

I'm a tennis player so I'm going to use that as an analogy. In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls. A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit. This gives the player additional time to process and understand their technique.

For instance, if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it. This would leave me open to the possibility that I would do it incorrectly before the proper swing was ingrained in my head/body.

I think a lot of these training videos operate on somewhat the same principle. Sure you'll probably never be attacked in *exactly* the same manner that they are demonstrating, but that's not the point. The point is that in learning some basic principles in a controlled environment you can begin to develop the skills necessary for real-life situations.

The guy in the video isn't suggesting that if you just watch that video you'll be ok to go out and win any street fight, so I think you're misinterpreting the purpose.

T2	Rhetorical_Statement 151 186	I'm going to use that as an analogy
T3	Value 188 263	In tennis, we often times practice new techniques with slow, hand-fed balls
T4	Testimony 265 329	A coach will stand close and toss a ball easily up for us to hit

T6	Value 427 521	if I were to learn a forehand from scratch I wouldn't want to go out and just start hitting it
T7	Value 523 651	This would leave me open to the possibility that I would do it incorrectly before the proper swing was ingrained in my head/body

T13	Value 1141 1175	you're misinterpreting the purpose

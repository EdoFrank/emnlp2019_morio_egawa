op_title: I believe that canned techniques for self-defense won't really help someone in a real life situation. CMV.

Karate student here. We have a few types of learning, and we learn the canned moves. We learn how to perfectly execute a shuto sakotsu uchi, a downward knife hand strike. We learn how to do a perfectly formed inside middle block. We even hold separate courses on "street self-defense", teaching how to get out of holds and what to do in what situation.

However, when it comes to Kumite, fighting, all of that goes away. No one pays attention to proper form, they just block, strike, and dodge. But does this mean that all the technical learning didn't help? Not even close. I can't touch the black belts in Kumite, even the ones that are 5 years younger than me and have far shorter arms. No one is expected to perfectly execute what they're taught, but in being taught the canned moves, they learn what the moves should look like, how they work, and what they're supposed to do, and in that they can use them more effectively, in their own way, in real combat. While I may not bring my hand all the way up and strike exactly at the collarbone with a shuto sakotsu uchi, I'll certainly instinctively form my hand into the right position, bring my hand as high as time constraints allow me to do, and then strike more effectively at the area I know my strike will be most effective. None of that will be exactly proper form, just as you'll most likely never use the exact same moves that you see in those videos. But the things you do learn do allow you to know the general move, and utilize it for your purpose when you can.

Watching a couple videos will obviously not be enough to give you an adequate measure of self-defense ability. But canned techniques, when adequately practiced, can definitely help in a real life situation.

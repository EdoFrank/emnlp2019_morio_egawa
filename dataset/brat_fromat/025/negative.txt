Grades aren't supposed to translate into real-world experience! That's why you should pursue internships, join clubs, participate in social activities, be a leader and blaze your own trail. High grades are valuable in telling employers that you could be a focused, diligent, quick-learning, and capable worker. A 4.0 student might learn quickly or retain information well, and that is important. But what matters is what that student does with that information to be a decision maker.

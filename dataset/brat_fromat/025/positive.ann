T1	Testimony 81 165	I sometimes "hire" undergraduate volunteers for internships at a research laboratory
T2	Testimony 167 325	The advice I got from professors when I started to do this was to set a reasonably high minimum GPA (e.g., 3.3) and not even consider anyone who fell below it
T3	Testimony 327 417	After breaking that rule a few times and getting burned, I've come to see the wisdom of it
T4	Value 451 525	GPA is ***not*** a valid measure of how enthusiastic or capable someone is
T5	Value 530 589	GPA ***is*** a valid measurement of how reliable someone is
T6	Value 593 938	When I'm scheduling brainwave recording sessions, I need to know with absolute certainty that the person I hired to help me collect data is not going to sleep through their alarm, miss their bus for the second time this week, lose their grandmother for the third time this year, drop out of contact all weekend because they're getting drunk, etc
T7	Value 942 1127	A high GPA tells me that someone is willing to prioritize the work that they promised to do, even when it gets boring or they don't feel like it or it interferes with their social plans

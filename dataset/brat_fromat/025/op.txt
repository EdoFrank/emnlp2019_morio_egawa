Ok, lets say I got a 3.7 GPA throughout my education. What does that mean? Am I really more qualified than a person who has a 3.6 GPA? How do grades translate into real-wold experience? I believe that someone who has done internships and has experience but who's GPA is a 2.5 is more likely to land a job than someone who has a 4.0 but no valuable experience

Apparently my original account got shadowbanned or something, so asking again:

I remember seeing some posts in askreddit about ADHD medications, and I was amazed when people mentioned how they were able to get motivated and focus on many activities for hours they would otherwise find boring and soon quit, like studying or just trying to learn certain topics. I think one person read about how mechanical clocks worked and designed one for himself while on the drugs. Based on these evidences I think they can be used to make people learn more, like in schools and many other possible environments. And if people know more and are motivated to something productive this will likely lead to better society in general.

I do realize potential side effects these drugs can bring, and how they can fuck people up both mentally physically if abused. Governmental regulation on usage of these drugs and help to people will help decrease these disastrous outcomes.

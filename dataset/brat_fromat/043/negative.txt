People shouldn't be given these drugs at all. If they want to use them, they should have to buy them. There is no reason the government should give people psychoactive drugs and there is no way we could afford them as is. 

The cost to medicate the entire US with adderall for a year, assuming a population of 313.9 million people taking one 20mg tablet given to them in packs of 60, which would be enough for two months, would cost over 103 billion dollars at the current market price of around 55 dollars per 60 20 mg tablets.  Now eventually, this would wear off and the 20mg adderall would not be enough to give the same effects so we might bump the dosage to 30 mg and then bump it further to 40 mg tablets and since I'm not a doctor or somebody qualified, I couldn't tell you where that ends. The costs are utterly ridiculous and I don't think we would see a growth in tax revenue that would allow us to recoup our losses. 

Furthermore, there are some risks involved with adderall that could boost the cost of our healthcare across the country, and also the level of accidental death due to an adderall overdose. 

There are simply too many variables involved in giving people these drugs. However I would not discourage the purchase of these drugs by people willing to put their own money towards them as I support the legalization of all illegal and prescription drugs and their purchase without a prescription.

op_title: I don't think "safe spaces" are a good idea. CMV

Let me clarify a bit. If a group is suffering physical abuse, then by all means, they should have a chance to speak openly without fear of retaliation. But that does not mean that you should stay within your little circle and refuse to listen to differing opinions. It can be beneficial to share with like-minded people, but I'm of the opinion that discussing with those who hold opposite view points is a much more beneficial exercise.

For me at least, any of my beliefs are always open to challenge. I don't feel the need to reinforce my ideas with a circlejerk - I'm confident in my ideals and I'm willing to argue them. If I *can't* argue one of my beliefs, then it needs to be reconsidered.

Therefore, I think safe spaces, where only those of a certain group are allowed to speak, are more often harmful than helpful.

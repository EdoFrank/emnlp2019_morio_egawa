T1	Value 69 302	Safe spaces aren't really created to hide people from other view points, after all, almost all of the people in these groups have to adjust to and communicate with people who have opinions other than their own in their everyday lives
T2	Value 304 369	There are a couple reasons why safe spaces can be very beneficial
T3	Value 433 635	Many of the people in these groups actually *have* either experience physical or emotional abuse as well as loss of jobs, relationships with family/friends, and social status, or been threatened with it
T4	Fact 651 827	my university has a confidential program (safe space) for people who think they might be LGBT but are questioning or can't come out for various often times very serious reasons
T5	Value 829 1070	The people who go to that group are already in an emotionally and socially vulnerable position in which speaking up in front of people who oppose them could be not only absolutely traumatizing in itself, but also potentially life devastating
T6	Value 1104 1296	many groups have such a history of being oppressed or abused by another group that this fear becomes omnipresent even when an individual has not been *openly and directly* threatened or abused
T7	Fact 1312 1469	[this study](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3150-women-speak-less.html) shows that women are 75% less likely to speak up in a space when outnumbered by men
T8	Value 1487 1660	bringing men, especially men who might vehemently disagree with what they are saying, into a safe space means for all intents and purposes shutting the women in the group up
T9	Value 1665 1919	The purpose of most safe spaces is not form a space that people spend all of their time lingering in and closing off from the world, but rather to find a group of other people who share common experiences who can give you advice, comfort, and reassurance
T10	Value 1933 2008	it is not only safe spaces that do this, but many different types of groups
T11	Rhetorical_Statement 2010 2231	It would be inappropriate to waltz into a church during services and proclaim why their religion is wrong, or walking into a sports bar during the Superbowl trying to tell people that sports are stupid and a waste of time
T12	Value 2233 2357	When people come together over a common interest/experience they are looking to find enjoyment and camaraderie, not to argue
T13	Value 2372 2521	people participate in these type of group events doesn't mean that the church goer or sports fan wouldn't be open to other viewpoints at another time
T14	Value 2523 2630	it simply means that in this one event or space they are not looking to battle their views out with another
T15	Value 2642 2811	people who participate in safe spaces are still open to discussion in other circumstances, but want the occasional comfort of and support of a group who understands them
T16	Value 2824 2939	most members of safe space groups live in societies which are not as receptive/encouraging of their views every day
T17	Value 2944 3002	it isn't as though they are hiding from the world entirely
T18	Value 3008 3231	Most of the rules and guidelines that define safe spaces are just to get people who typically feel shut down in normal conversations/debates for their views/sexuality/race/gender/whatever are able to express their viewpoint
T19	Value 3233 3396	Many people that I know are comfortable in their beliefs about something, but are too shy, insecure, fearful of being ostracized to be able to argue them to others
T20	Value 3402 3457	they still need some outlet for their thoughts/feelings
T21	Value 3459 3568	Whilst I think you and I both likely best communicate and explore our ideas through debate, some people can't
T22	Value 3577 3733	they feel attacked through this method of discourse, especially people who are members of groups who have been/are being systematically dismissed in society
T23	Value 3735 3974	Participating in a safe space gives those people the cathartic opportunity to say how they think/feel and hopefully even gain enough confidence through the encouragement of the group to express their views in the more public way you desire
T24	Value 3989 4068	**safe spaces can actually be beneficial to the creation of meaningful dialog**

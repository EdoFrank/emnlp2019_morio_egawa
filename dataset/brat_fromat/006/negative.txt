op_title: I don't think "safe spaces" are a good idea. CMV

Our society is geared towards white men. Part of that gearing is that their ideas and opinions are celebrated and encouraged, and as a consequence others might feel uncomfortable sharing their ideas and opinions in spaces dominated by straight white men.

You can observe this phenomenon yourself! Are you in school, university, or employed with a wide variety of people? Observe how often women and people of color speak up - particularly in spaces where they are a) new and/or b) in a numerical minority. I'm willing to bet it's significantly less than the white dudes speak up.

The other consequence of this, of course, is that if there's a straight white male opinion on an issue you better fucking believe *everyone* has heard it, because the straight while male opinions are the mainstream opinions. They're the op eds in your newspapers, they're the SCOTUS decisions, they're the authors of your magazine articles, etc. Sometimes it's nice to have a space where this particular viewpoint isn't belabored past the point where it's useful.

Finally, 'safe spaces' can also foster a discussion between a group of people who are all on the same page. No movement would ever get anywhere if it had the first hour of any given meeting trying to explain its core tenets to newcomers. If I want to hash out the specifics of intersectional feminism, I am most likely to accomplish that goal with a group of intersectional feminists. I *ought*, if I'm a good intersectional feminist, to have a good logical justification for intersectional feminism in general, but sometimes I don't want to have to *give* that justification every time I talk about it.

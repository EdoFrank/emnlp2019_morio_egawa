op_title: There are no defensible arguments for the existence of a god. CMV

I'm not asking anyone to convert me or prove god exists. This is purely about the existence of any defensible argument for the existence of God. I haven't found or heard any argument for god that doesn't fail in its premises, or by a subtle case of special pleading or circular logic. 

Because of this I have trouble believing people who were not theistic from childhood, but decided later in life that the existence of god makes logical sense, and I'd rather not suddenly feel that someone is a bit dumb because I don't know of any sensible argument that they could have run across to convince them. 

Edit:

Success, to /u/turole !

Tl:dr of the argument: 

To someone not versed in logic and theology, ontological and comsological arguments can be very convincing. They might not pick apart the arguments as heavily as I would, or it might not occur to them to pick apart the arguments. However, I should see this as a lack of theological or logical research/training/knowledge rather than seeing them as a little dumb. That is, ignorance is not stupidity.

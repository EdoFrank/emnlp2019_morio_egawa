op_title: There are no defensible arguments for the existence of a god. CMV

I'm an atheist personally, but one good argument I've heard for belief in general is that there is no way to live your life without belief. Logic itself is 'unproveable' (or at least so I've been told, and based on the arguments I've heard). Even probability itself, based on this fact is also 'unproveable'. So why do we use it? Because we believe out of pure faith that it does work. Religious people just take this a few steps further and believe in more things out of pure faith too. Ideas of arguing itself come from belief, so why does belief in a God then have to come from arguments?

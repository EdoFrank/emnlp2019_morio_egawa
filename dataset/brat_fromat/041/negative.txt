op_title: I believe all mentally disabled people should be sterilized. CMV

The US actually had a policy of forced sterilization in the 1900s. Check out the Buck v. Bell case. 

Basically, this resulted in many women (mostly minorities and lower class women) being labeled as 'mentally retarded' and being sterilized without their consent, when they were in fact NOT mentally retarded. 

While I don't disagree that people with severe mental disabilities shouldn't have children, our history of forced sterilization shows that such a law would leave itself open to abuse.

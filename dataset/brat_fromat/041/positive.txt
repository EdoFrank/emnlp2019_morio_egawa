* Autism is a spectrum disorder.  Many people on the spectrum live typical lives, have degrees, careers, get married, and have families.  There is no objective boundary of where you go from low functioning to high functioning autism. Additionally, it hasn't been determined whether autism is hereditary.  Most research seems to indicate it is more likely environmental.

* Downs syndrome is a mutation that causes sterility, so people with downs syndrome don't have children, and there is no genetic cause for it.

* There are many types of intellectual disabilities, but the most common ones are not caused by genetic factors.  In fact, the most common cause for intellectual disabilities is probably fetal alcohol syndrome.  

* People need to have the right to bodily autonomy.  Forcing a person to undergo surgery against their will would probably violate our constitution's right to privacy.

* This type of approach has been tried before, and it has always led to major human rights violations.  The most well-known example is the Nazis.  They forcibly sterilized all kinds of disabled people, including thousands of deaf people, who used to be considered intellectually disabled.

* I think it's important when you're forming an opinion about something, especially where the stakes are so high, to do some research about how the experts feel about it.  In this case, disability rights advocates are the ones who know the issues surrounding this question.  They understand the needs of individuals with disabilities.  Almost universally, disability rights advocates do not believe in forced sterilization.  I'm not saying that just because a lot of people believe it, it's necessarily right, but it is a factor to consider when deciding how to feel about the subject.
